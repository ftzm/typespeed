I never heard of it before.\"", "\"Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence--\"", "The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.", "\"Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!\"", "The child began to cry. Tom said:", "\"Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.\"", "\"Yes, you do, Tom--you know you do.\"", "\"Becky, I--I don't care for anybody but you.\"", "\"Becky\"--pleadingly. \"Becky, won't you say something?\"", "Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:", "\"Please, Becky, won't you take it?\"", "She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:", "\"What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!\"", "Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment was bound-less! He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:", "\"Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!\"", "The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright.", "\"He dasn't tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.\"", "\"Brother, go find your brother!\"", "He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each other.", "\"Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.\"", "Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom called:", "\"Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?\"", "\"Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that--that--\"", "\"Dares to hold such language,\" said Tom, prompting--for they talked \"by the book,\" from memory.", "\"Who art thou that dares to hold such language?\"", "\"I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.\"", "\"Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!\"", "They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, \"two up and two down.\" Presently Tom said:", "\"Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!\"", "So they \"went it lively,\" panting and perspiring with the work. By and by Tom shouted:", "\"Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?\"", "\"I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of it.\"", "\"Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back.\"", "There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and fell.", "\"Now,\" said Joe, getting up, \"you got to let me kill _you_. That's fair.\"", "\"Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.\"", "\"Well, it's blamed mean--that's all.\"", "\"Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.\"", "Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a whisper:", "\"Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?\"", "\"I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, _ain't_ it?\"", "There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered:", "\"Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?\"", "\"O' course he does. Least his sperrit does.\"", "\"I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls him Hoss.\"", "\"A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead people, Tom.\"", "This was a damper, and conversation died again.", "Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:", "\"What is it, Tom?\" And the two clung together with beating hearts.", "\"Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?\"", "\"Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?\"", "\"I dono. Think they'll see us?\"", "\"Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't come.\"", "\"Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at all.\"", "\"I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.\"", "The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.", "\"Look! See there!\" whispered Tom. \"What is it?\"", "\"It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.\"", "Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:", "\"It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners! Can you pray?\"", "\"I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I lay me down to sleep, I--'\"", "\"They're _humans_! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's voice.\"", "\"I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!\"", "\"All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's Injun Joe.\"", "\"That's so--that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a dern sight. What kin they be up to?\"", "The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.", "\"Here it is,\" said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.", "\"Hurry, men!\" he said, in a low voice; \"the moon might come out at any moment.\"", "\"Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with another five, or here she stays.\"", "\"That's the talk!\" said Injun Joe.", "\"Look here, what does this mean?\" said the doctor. \"You required your pay in advance, and I've paid you.\"", "He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground. Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:", "Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:", "\"_That_ score is settled--damn you.\"", "\"Lord, how is this, Joe?\" he said.", "\"It's a dirty business,\" said Joe, without moving.", "\"Look here! That kind of talk won't wash.\"", "Potter trembled and grew white.", "\"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched you another awful clip--and here you've laid, as dead as a wedge til now.\"", "\"No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say.\"", "\"Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I live.\" And Potter began to cry.", "\"Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering. You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any tracks behind you.\"", "Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:", "\"If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself--chicken-heart!\"", "Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the moon's. The stillness was complete again, too.", "\"If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!\" whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. \"I can't stand it much longer.\"", "\"Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?\"", "\"If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it.\"", "Tom thought a while, then he said:", "\"What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe _didn't_ hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as we're a laying here.\"", "\"That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.\"", "\"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's generally drunk enough.\"", "Tom said nothing--went on thinking. Presently he whispered:", "\"Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?\"", "\"What's the reason he don't know it?\"", "\"Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?\"", "\"And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!\"", "After another reflective silence, Tom said:", "\"Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?\"", "\"Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak 'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep mum.\"", "\"I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear that we--\"", "\"Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little rubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing 'bout a big thing like this. And blood.\"", "\"Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.\"", "Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:", "\"Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on it.\"", "\"It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once--you'll see.\"", "A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.", "\"Tom,\" whispered Huckleberry, \"does this keep us from _ever_ telling--_always_?\"", "\"Of course it does. It don't make any difference _what_ happens, we got to keep mum. We'd drop down dead--don't _you_ know that?\"", "They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.", "\"Which of us does he mean?\" gasped Huckleberry.", "\"I dono--peep through the crack. Quick!\"", "\"I can't--I can't _do_ it, Huck!\"", "\"Please, Tom. There 'tis again!\"", "\"Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!\" whispered Tom. \"I know his voice. It's Bull Harbison.\" *", "[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as \"Harbison's Bull,\" but a son or a dog of that name was \"Bull Harbison.\"]", "\"Oh, that's good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet anything it was a _stray_ dog.\"", "The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.", "\"Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!\" whispered Huckleberry. \"_Do_, Tom!\"", "Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His whisper was hardly audible when he said:", "\"Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?\"", "\"Huck, he must mean us both--we're right together.\"", "\"Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout where _I'll_ go to. I been so wicked.\"", "\"Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller's told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried--but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay I'll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!\" And Tom began to snuffle a little.", "\"_You_ bad!\" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. \"Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am. Oh, _lordy_, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.\"", "\"Look, Hucky, look! He's got his _back_ to us!\"", "Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.", "\"Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?\"", "\"Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you know. _Now_ who can he mean?\"", "The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.", "\"Sh! What's that?\" he whispered.", "\"Sounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it's somebody snoring, Tom.\"", "\"That _is_ it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?\"", "\"I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more.\"", "The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.", "\"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?\"", "\"I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!\"", "\"Oh, geeminy, it's _him_!\" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.", "\"Say, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there ain't anybody dead there yet.\"", "\"Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?\"", "\"Yes, but she ain't _dead_. And what's more, she's getting better, too.\"", "\"All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about these kind of things, Huck.\"", "Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.", "This final feather broke the camel's back.", "\"Poor fellow!\" \"Poor young fellow!\" \"This ought to be a lesson to grave robbers!\" \"Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him!\" This was the drift of remark; and the minister said, \"It was a judgment; His hand is here.\"", "Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle, and voices shouted, \"It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!\"", "\"Who? Who?\" from twenty voices.", "\"Hallo, he's stopped!--Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!\"", "People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.", "\"Infernal impudence!\" said a bystander; \"wanted to come and take a quiet look at his work, I reckon--didn't expect any company.\"", "\"I didn't do it, friends,\" he sobbed; \"'pon my word and honor I never done it.\"", "\"Who's accused you?\" shouted a voice.", "This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and exclaimed:", "\"Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never--\"", "\"Is that your knife?\" and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.", "Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the ground. Then he said:", "\"Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get--\" He shuddered; then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, \"Tell 'em, Joe, tell 'em--it ain't any use any more.\"", "\"Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?\" somebody said.", "\"I couldn't help it--I couldn't help it,\" Potter moaned. \"I wanted to run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here.\" And he fell to sobbing again.", "They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.", "\"It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.\"", "Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:", "\"Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time.\"", "Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.", "\"It's a bad sign,\" said Aunt Polly, gravely. \"What you got on your mind, Tom?\"", "\"Nothing. Nothing 't I know of.\" But the boy's hand shook so that he spilled his coffee.", "\"And you do talk such stuff,\" Sid said. \"Last night you said, 'It's blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over. And you said, 'Don't torment me so--I'll tell!' Tell _what_? What is it you'll tell?\"", "Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said:", "\"Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it.\"", "One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging for a taste. Tom said:", "\"Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter.\"", "But Peter signified that he did want it.", "\"Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame anybody but your own self.\"", "\"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?\"", "\"I don't know, aunt,\" gasped the boy.", "\"Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?\"", "\"Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a good time.\"", "\"They do, do they?\" There was something in the tone that made Tom apprehensive.", "\"Yes'm. That is, I believe they do.\"", "\"Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?\"", "\"I done it out of pity for him--because he hadn't any aunt.\"", "\"Hadn't any aunt!--you numskull. What has that got to do with it?\"", "\"Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a human!\"", "Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom's head and said gently:", "\"I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.\"", "Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity.", "\"I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It done _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since--\"", "\"Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any more medicine.\"", "Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and crestfallen.", "\"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.\"", "\"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.\" Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.", "\"'Tis well. Give the countersign.\"", "Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night:", "Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it, tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.", "They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:", "\"Luff, and bring her to the wind!\"", "As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for \"style,\" and were not intended to mean anything in particular.", "\"Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir.\"", "\"Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye--foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!\"", "\"Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!\"", "\"Hellum-a-lee--hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port, port! _Now_, men! With a will!

They could have found a cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire.", "\"It's _nuts_!\" said Tom. \"What would the boys say if they could see us?\"", "\"Say? Well, they'd just die to be here--hey, Hucky!\"", "\"I reckon so,\" said Huckleberry; \"anyways, I'm suited. I don't want nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally--and here they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.\"", "\"Oh yes, that's so,\" said Joe, \"but I hadn't thought much about it, you know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it.\"", "\"You see,\" said Tom, \"people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And a hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--\"", "\"What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?\" inquired Huck.", "\"I dono. But they've _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do that if you was a hermit.\"", "\"Dern'd if I would,\" said Huck.", "\"I dono. But I wouldn't do that.\"", "\"Why, Huck, you'd _have_ to. How'd you get around it?\"", "\"Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away.\"", "\"Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be a disgrace.\"", "\"What does pirates have to do?\"", "\"Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make 'em walk a plank.\"", "\"And they carry the women to the island,\" said Joe; \"they don't kill the women.\"", "\"No,\" assented Tom, \"they don't kill the women--they're too noble. And the women's always beautiful, too.", "\"And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver and di'monds,\" said Joe, with enthusiasm.", "Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.", "\"I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate,\" said he, with a regretful pathos in his voice; \"but I ain't got none but these.\"", "But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough, after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.", "\"What is it!\" exclaimed Joe, under his breath.", "\"I wonder,\" said Tom in a whisper.", "\"'Tain't thunder,\" said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, \"becuz thunder--\"", "\"Hark!\" said Tom. \"Listen--don't talk.\"", "They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush.", "\"I know now!\" exclaimed Tom; \"somebody's drownded!\"", "\"Yes, I've heard about that,\" said Joe. \"I wonder what makes the bread do that.\"", "\"Oh, it ain't the bread, so much,\" said Tom; \"I reckon it's mostly what they _say_ over it before they start it out.\"", "\"But they don't say anything over it,\" said Huck. \"I've seen 'em and they don't.\"", "\"Well, that's funny,\" said Tom. \"But maybe they say it to themselves. Of _course_ they do. Anybody might know that.\"", "The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity.", "\"By jings, I wish I was over there, now,\" said Joe.", "\"I do too\" said Huck \"I'd give heaps to know who it is.\"", "The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:", "\"Boys, I know who's drownded--it's us!\"", "\"What makes the candle blow so?\" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. \"Why, that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid.\"", "Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and \"breathed\" himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt's foot.", "\"But as I was saying,\" said Aunt Polly, \"he warn't _bad_, so to say--only misch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was\"--and she began to cry.", "\"I hope Tom's better off where he is,\" said Sid, \"but if he'd been better in some ways--\"", "Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.", "\"No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that sort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?\"", "\"Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?\"", "\"Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't back here to breakfast.\"", "\"Which he is!\" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping grandly into camp.", "\"I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore it again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?\"", "But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy. Finally he said:", "\"Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome.\"", "\"Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by,\" said Tom. \"Just think of the fishing that's here.\"", "\"I don't care for fishing. I want to go home.\"", "\"But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere.\"", "\"Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home.\"", "\"Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.\"", "\"Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one. I ain't any more baby than you are.\" And Joe snuffled a little.", "\"Well, we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck? Poor thing--does it want to see its mother? And so it shall.

We'll stay, won't we?\"", "Huck said, \"Y-e-s\"--without any heart in it.", "\"I'll never speak to you again as long as I live,\" said Joe, rising. \"There now!\" And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.", "\"Who cares!\" said Tom. \"Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't crybabies. We'll stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per'aps.\"", "\"I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom.\"", "\"I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.\"", "\"Well, go 'long--who's hendering you.\"", "Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:", "\"Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for you when we get to shore.\"", "\"Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all.\"", "\"Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!\"", "Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:", "\"Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt long ago.\"", "\"So would I,\" said Joe. \"It's just nothing.\"", "\"Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could,\" said Tom.", "\"That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk just that way--haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't.\"", "\"Yes--heaps of times,\" said Huck.", "\"Well, I have too,\" said Tom; \"oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember, Huck, 'bout me saying that?\"", "\"Yes, that's so,\" said Huck. \"That was the day after I lost a white alley. No, 'twas the day before.\"", "\"There--I told you so,\" said Tom. \"Huck recollects it.\"", "\"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,\" said Joe. \"I don't feel sick.\"", "\"Neither do I,\" said Tom. \"I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff Thatcher couldn't.\"", "\"Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him try it once. _He'd_ see!\"", "\"I bet he would. And Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it once.\"", "\"Oh, don't I!\" said Joe. \"Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.\"", "\"'Deed it would, Joe. Say--I wish the boys could see us now.\"", "\"By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!\"", "\"So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating, won't they wish they'd been along?\"", "\"Oh, I reckon not! I'll just _bet_ they will!\"", "\"I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.\"", "Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:", "\"I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring. No, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it.\"", "So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome, and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.", "They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look, and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well--something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them.", "\"Quick! boys, go for the tent!\" exclaimed Tom.", "By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.", "In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing there to comfort her. She soliloquized:", "\"Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got anything now to remember him by.\" And she choked back a little sob.", "Presently she stopped, and said to herself:", "\"It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say that--I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll never, never, never see him any more.\"", "\"Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.\"", "But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that, and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.", "\"Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck.\"", "\"And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!\" And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.", "Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: \"Praise God from whom all blessings flow--_sing_!--and put your hearts in it!\"", "And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his life.", "As the \"sold\" congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that once more.", "Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to Aunt Polly's varying moods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.", "At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:", "\"Yes, you could have done that, Tom,\" said Mary; \"and I believe you would if you had thought of it.\"", "\"Would you, Tom?\" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. \"Say, now, would you, if you'd thought of it?\"", "\"I--well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.\"", "\"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,\" said Aunt Polly, with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy. \"It would have been something if you'd cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn't _do_ it.\"", "\"Now, auntie, that ain't any harm,\" pleaded Mary; \"it's only Tom's giddy way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.\"", "\"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and _done_ it, too.

That's something, ain't it?\"", "\"It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing. What did you dream?\"", "\"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.\"", "\"Well, so we did. So we always do.

Go on!\"", "\"And then--and then--well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if you made Sid go and--and--\"", "\"Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?\"", "\"You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.\"", "\"Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my days!

Next you said I warn't _bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.\"", "\"And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!\"", "\"So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither.

We've got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it.\"", "\"Well, I'll come around and maow tonight.\"", "\"All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes.\"", "\"It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again.\"", "\"Well, but we _can't_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.\"", "\"I know it, but then there's another thing.\"", "\"Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too early.\"", "\"Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.\"", "\"Yes, they do. I've always heard that.\"", "\"Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure.\"", "\"I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something!\"", "\"Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit.\"", "\"Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else.\"", "\"All right, I reckon we better.\"", "Tom considered awhile; and then said:", "\"The ha'nted house. That's it!\"", "\"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't hender us from digging there in the daytime.\"", "\"Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that ha'nted house in the day nor the night.\"", "\"Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been murdered, anyway--but nothing's ever been seen around that house except in the night--just some blue lights slipping by the windows--no regular ghosts.\"", "\"Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em.\"", "\"Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so what's the use of our being afeard?\"", "\"Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so--but I reckon it's taking chances.\"", "ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was measurably so, also--but suddenly said:", "\"Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?\"", "Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them--", "\"My! I never once thought of it, Huck!\"", "\"Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.\"", "\"Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.\"", "\"_Might_! Better say we _would_! There's some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain't.\"", "\"Any fool knows that. I don't reckon _you_ was the first that found it out, Huck.\"", "\"Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had a rotten bad dream last night--dreampt about rats.\"", "\"No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?\"", "\"Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?\"", "\"Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the best. He was a robber.\"", "\"Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?\"", "\"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with 'em perfectly square.\"", "\"Well, he must 'a' been a brick.\"", "\"I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.\"", "\"I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse. But we'll play Robin Hood--it's nobby fun. I'll learn you.\"", "\"What is it?\" whispered Huck, blanching with fright.", "\"Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door.\"", "The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.", "\"They've stopped.... No--coming.... Here they are. Don't whisper another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!\"", "Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: \"There's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately--never saw t'other man before.\"", "\"No,\" said he, \"I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's dangerous.\"", "\"Dangerous!\" grunted the \"deaf and dumb\" Spaniard--to the vast surprise of the boys. \"Milksop!\"", "This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's! There was silence for some time. Then Joe said:", "\"What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing's come of it.\"", "\"That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about. 'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't succeed.\"", "\"Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody would suspicion us that saw us.\"", "\"I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view.\"", "\"Those infernal boys\" quaked again under the inspiration of this remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a year.", "The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:", "This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe said:", "\"I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch.\"", "He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.", "The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:", "\"I can't--I'd die if they was to wake.\"", "Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him up with his foot and said:", "\"Here! _You're_ a watchman, ain't you! All right, though--nothing's happened.\"", "\"Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we do with what little swag we've got left?\"", "\"I don't know--leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's something to carry.\"", "\"Well--all right--it won't matter to come here once more.\"", "\"No--but I'd say come in the night as we used to do--it's better.\"", "\"Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a very good place; we'll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.\"", "Joe's knife struck upon something.", "\"What is it?\" said his comrade.", "\"Half-rotten plank--no, it's a box, I believe. Here--bear a hand and we'll see what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole.\"", "He reached his hand in and drew it out--", "The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.", "\"We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--I saw it a minute ago.\"", "\"Pard, there's thousands of dollars here,\" said Injun Joe.", "\"'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one summer,\" the stranger observed.", "\"I know it,\" said Injun Joe; \"and this looks like it, I should say.\"", "\"Now you won't need to do that job.\"", "The halfbreed frowned. Said he:", "\"You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't robbery altogether--it's _revenge_!\" and a wicked light flamed in his eyes. \"I'll need your help in it. When it's finished--then Texas. Go home to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.\"", "\"Well--if you say so; what'll we do with this--bury it again?\"", "\"Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number One?\"", "\"No--Number Two--under the cross. The other place is bad--too common.\"", "\"All right. It's nearly dark enough to start.\"", "Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out. Presently he said:", "\"Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be upstairs?\"", "Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving. Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.", "They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to \"Number Two,\" wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom.", "\"Revenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!\"", "\"Oh, don't!\" said Huck, nearly fainting.", "They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else--at least that he might at least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.", "Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company would be a palpable improvement, he thought.", "\"Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd 'a' got the money. Oh, ain't it awful!\"", "\"'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was. Dog'd if I don't, Huck.\"", "\"Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.\"", "\"Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream it was! I've had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through 'em--rot him!\"", "\"No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!\"", "\"Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance for such a pile--and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him, anyway.\"", "\"Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to his Number Two.\"", "\"Number Two--yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?\"", "\"I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck--maybe it's the number of a house!\"", "\"Goody!... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here.\"", "\"Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here--it's the number of a room--in a tavern, you know!\"", "\"Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out quick.\"", "\"You stay here, Huck, till I come.\"", "\"That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're after.\"", "\"I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?\"", "Tom thought a long time. Then he said:", "\"Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!\"", "\"Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you--and if he did, maybe he'd never think anything.\"", "\"Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono--I dono. I'll try.\"", "\"You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a' found out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money.\"", "\"It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!\"", "\"Now you're _talking_! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't.\"", "\"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!\"", "\"Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.\"", "\"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?\"", "\"No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and started!\"", "\"I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!\"", "\"Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.\"", "\"Say, Tom, did you see that box?\"", "\"Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?\"", "\"Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?\"", "\"Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's drunk.\"", "\"And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.\"", "There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:", "\"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n lightning.\"", "\"Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job.\"", "\"All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow--and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that'll fetch me.\"", "\"Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?\"", "\"I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.\"", "\"That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?\"", "\"Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night, just skip right around and maow.\"", "\"You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.\"", "\"Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.\"", "\"Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.\"", "Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:", "\"Say--I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll have ice-cream! She has it most every day--dead loads of it. And she'll be awful glad to have us.\"", "Then Becky reflected a moment and said:", "The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:", "\"But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!\"", "Now there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe's:", "\"Damn her, maybe she's got company--there's lights, late as it is.\"", "\"Because the bush is in your way. Now--this way--now you see, don't you?\"", "\"Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.\"", "\"Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!\"", "\"Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't kill her--bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils--you notch her ears like a sow!\"", "\"Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the better--I'm all in a shiver.\"", "\"Do it _now_? And company there? Look here--I'll get suspicious of you, first thing you know. No--we'll wait till the lights are out--there's no hurry.\"", "\"What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?\"", "\"Let me in--quick! I'll tell everything.\"", "\"Huckleberry Finn--quick, let me in!\"", "\"Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge! But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble.\"", "\"Please don't ever tell I told you,\" were Huck's first words when he got in. \"Please don't--I'd be killed, sure--but the widow's been good friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell--I _will_ tell if you'll promise you won't ever say it was me.\"", "\"By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!\" exclaimed the old man; \"out with it and nobody here'll ever tell, lad.\"", "Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him.", "AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:", "Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:", "\"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!\"", "\"It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome!\"", "\"Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too--make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here last night.\"", "\"I was awful scared,\" said Huck, \"and I run. I took out when the pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.\"", "\"Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.\"", "\"Splendid! Describe them--describe them, my boy!\"", "\"One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged--\"", "\"That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell the sheriff--get your breakfast tomorrow morning!\"", "The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck sprang up and exclaimed:", "\"Oh, please don't tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh, please!\"", "\"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did.\"", "\"Oh no, no! Please don't tell!\"", "When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:", "\"They won't tell--and I won't. But why don't you want it known?\"", "Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for knowing it, sure.", "The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:", "\"How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking suspicious?\"", "Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:", "\"Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?\"", "This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:", "\"Well, I don't know--but somehow it seems as if I did.\"", "\"Follered 'em--yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up--they sneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just as I told you and your two--\"", "\"What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!\"", "Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and whispered in his ear:", "\"'Tain't a Spaniard--it's Injun Joe!\"", "The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:", "\"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter altogether.\"", "During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of--", "If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide, now, and his breath suspended--waiting for the answer. The Welshman started--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten--then replied:", "\"Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the _matter_ with you?\"", "Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:", "\"Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we'd found?\"", "Huck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing suggested itself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a senseless reply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it--feebly:", "Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because it cut down the doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:", "\"Poor old chap, you're white and jaded--you ain't well a bit--no wonder you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.\"", "\"Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but for him.\"", "Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:", "\"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?\"", "\"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come again--they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They've just come back.\"", "More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more.", "\"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to death.\"", "\"Yes,\" with a startled look--\"didn't she stay with you last night?\"", "Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:", "\"Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night--one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to settle with him.\"", "Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.", "\"He didn't stay with us,\" said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.", "\"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?\"", "\"You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands.\"", "Huck started up in bed, wildeyed:", "\"Liquor!--and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child--what a turn you did give me!\"", "\"Only tell me just one thing--only just one--please! Was it Tom Sawyer that found it?\"", "The widow burst into tears. \"Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you before, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!\"", "Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever--gone forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.", "These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:", "\"There--he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.\"", "\"Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others.\"", "\"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don't know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear them here.\"", "\"I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back.\"", "\"Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better.\"", "\"Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me.\"", "\"I reckon I could find it--but then the bats. If they put our candles out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go through there.\"", "\"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!\" and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.", "\"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right away!\"", "\"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get worse and worse off all the time.\"", "Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.", "\"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,\" said Becky.", "\"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,\" and he shouted again.", "\"Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!\"", "\"Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to come back! No--I can't find the way. It's all mixed up.\"", "\"Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful place! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!\"", "By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets--yet he must economize.", "\"Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again.\"", "\"I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find the way out.\"", "\"We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I reckon we are going there.\"", "\"Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying.\"", "Tom took something out of his pocket.", "\"Do you remember this?\" said he.", "\"Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got.\"", "\"I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup people do with wedding-cake--but it'll be our--\"", "She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he said:", "\"Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?\"", "Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.", "\"Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink. That little piece is our last candle!\"", "Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:", "\"They'll miss us and hunt for us!\"", "\"Yes, they will! Certainly they will!\"", "\"Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom.\"", "\"Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.\"", "\"When would they miss us, Tom?\"", "\"When they get back to the boat, I reckon.\"", "\"Tom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn't come?\"", "\"I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they got home.\"", "The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then--the horror of utter darkness reigned!", "The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted desire.", "Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.", "\"It's them!\" said Tom; \"they're coming! Come along, Becky--we're all right now!\"", "The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.", "Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind them, and informed of the great news.", "\"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt. But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any more.\"", "\"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and triple-locked--and I've got the keys.\"", "Tom turned as white as a sheet.", "\"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!\"", "The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.", "\"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?\"", "\"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!\"", "WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of men were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well filled with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.", "\"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you was to watch there that night?\"", "\"Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder's.\"", "\"Yes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him, and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.\"", "Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only heard of the Welshman's part of it before.", "\"Well,\" said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, \"whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways it's a goner for us, Tom.\"", "\"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!\"", "\"What!\" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. \"Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?\"", "\"Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?\"", "\"Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in there with me and help get it out?\"", "\"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost.\"", "\"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world.\"", "\"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's--\"", "\"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will, by jings.\"", "\"All right--it's a whiz. When do you say?\"", "\"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?\"", "\"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days, now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could.\"", "\"All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I had some when I was in there before.\"", "A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles below \"Cave Hollow,\" Tom said:", "\"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's one of my marks. We'll get ashore, now.\"", "\"Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.\"", "Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:", "\"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?\"", "\"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people--that's mostly the way.\"", "\"No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.\"", "\"Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.\"", "\"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all that.\"", "\"Now I'll show you something, Huck.\"", "He held his candle aloft and said:", "\"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on the big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.\"", "\"_Now_ where's your Number Two? '_under the cross_,' hey? Right yonder's where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!\"", "Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:", "\"What! and leave the treasure?\"", "\"Yes--leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain.\"", "\"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he died--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.\"", "\"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of ghosts, and so do you.\"", "Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him--", "\"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!\"", "The point was well taken. It had its effect.", "\"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.\"", "\"He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground.\"", "They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:", "\"Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's that for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I'm going to dig in the clay.\"", "\"That ain't no bad notion, Tom!\" said Huck with animation.", "Tom's \"real Barlow\" was out at once, and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood.", "\"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!\"", "It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.", "\"Got it at last!\" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand. \"My, but we're rich, Tom!\"", "\"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but we _have_ got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.\"", "It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.", "\"I thought so,\" he said; \"_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of fetching the little bags along.\"", "The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock.", "\"Now less fetch the guns and things,\" said Huck.", "\"No, Huck--leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies.\"", "\"I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff.\"", "\"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here--hurry up, trot ahead--I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?\"", "\"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's human nature--hurry along, hurry along!\"", "The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.", "\"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'.\"", "Huck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being falsely accused:", "\"Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing.\"", "\"Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you and the widow good friends?\"", "\"Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway.\"", "\"All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?\"", "This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room. Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.", "\"Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.\"", "\"And you did just right,\" said the widow. \"Come with me, boys.\"", "She took them to a bedchamber and said:", "\"Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes--shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's--no, no thanks, Huck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both of you. Get into them. We'll wait--come down when you are slicked up enough.\"", "HUCK said: \"Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain't high from the ground.\"", "\"Shucks! what do you want to slope for?\"", "\"Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't going down there, Tom.\"", "\"Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care of you.\"", "\"Tom,\" said he, \"auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about you. Say--ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?\"", "\"Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this blowout about, anyway?\"", "\"It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something, if you want to know.\"", "\"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop pretty flat.\"", "Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.", "\"Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told--that's enough.\"", "The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:", "\"Huck don't need it. Huck's rich.\"", "Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:", "\"Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it. Oh, you needn't smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.\"", "Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed interest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.", "\"Sid, what ails Tom?\" said Aunt Polly. \"He--well, there ain't ever any making of that boy out. I never--\"", "Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said:", "\"There--what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!\"", "\"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm willing to allow.\"", "The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property.", "Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or both.", "\"Well, everybody does that way, Huck.\"", "\"Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if you'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.\"", "\"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning robber.\"", "\"No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?\"", "\"Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know.\"", "\"Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?\"", "\"Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a pirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up in the nobility--dukes and such.\"", "\"Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?\"", "\"Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I _don't_ want to--but what would people say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't.\"", "Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he said:", "\"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom.\"", "\"All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck.\"", "\"Will you, Tom--now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?\"", "\"Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation tonight, maybe.\"", "\"It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang.\"", "\"That's gay--that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.\"", "\"Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha'nted house is the best, but they're all ripped up now.\"", "\"Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom.\"", "\"Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with blood.\"", "\"Now, that's something _like_! Why, it's a million times bullier than pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.\"", "\"Enter, then, and look,\" said Father Wolf stiffly, \"but there is no food here.\"", "\"For a wolf, no,\" said Tabaqui, \"but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people], to pick and choose?\" He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily.", "\"All thanks for this good meal,\" he said, licking his lips. \"How beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning.\"", "Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.", "Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then he said spitefully:", "\"Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. He will hunt among these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.\"", "Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty miles away.", "\"He has no right!\" Father Wolf began angrily--\"By the Law of the Jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He will frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for two, these days.\"", "\"Shall I tell him of your gratitude?\" said Tabaqui.", "\"Out!\" snapped Father Wolf. \"Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast done harm enough for one night.\"", "\"I go,\" said Tabaqui quietly. \"Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the thickets. I might have saved myself the message.\"", "Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little river he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.", "\"The fool!\" said Father Wolf. \"To begin a night's work with that noise! Does he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?\"", "\"H'sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,\" said Mother Wolf. \"It is Man.\"", "The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.", "\"Man!\" said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. \"Faugh! Are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on our ground too!\"", "The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated \"Aaarh!\" of the tiger's charge.", "Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan. \"He has missed,\" said Mother Wolf. \"What is it?\"", "Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub.", "\"The fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter's campfire, and has burned his feet,\" said Father Wolf with a grunt. \"Tabaqui is with him.\"", "\"Something is coming uphill,\" said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. \"Get ready.\"", "\"Man!\" he snapped. \"A man's cub. Look!\"", "Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked brown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom as ever came to a wolf's cave at night. He looked up into Father Wolf's face, and laughed.", "\"Is that a man's cub?\" said Mother Wolf. \"I have never seen one. Bring it here.\"", "A Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolf's jaws closed right on the child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs.", "\"How little! How naked, and--how bold!\" said Mother Wolf softly. The baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide. \"Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a man's cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man's cub among her children?\"", "\"I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in my time,\" said Father Wolf. \"He is altogether without hair, and I could kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not afraid.\"", "The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan's great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui, behind him, was squeaking: \"My lord, my lord, it went in here!\"", "\"Shere Khan does us great honor,\" said Father Wolf, but his eyes were very angry. \"What does Shere Khan need?\"", "\"My quarry. A man's cub went this way,\" said Shere Khan. \"Its parents have run off. Give it to me.\"", "\"The Wolves are a free people,\" said Father Wolf. \"They take orders from the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man's cub is ours--to kill if we choose.\"", "\"Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog's den for my fair dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!\"", "The tiger's roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.", "\"Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will come in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!\"", "Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf said to her gravely:", "\"Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack. Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?\"", "\"But what will our Pack say?\" said Father Wolf.", "At last--and Mother Wolf's neck bristles lifted as the time came--Father Wolf pushed \"Mowgli the Frog,\" as they called him, into the center, where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in the moonlight.", "\"Who speaks for this cub?\" said Akela. \"Among the Free People who speaks?\" There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight, if things came to fighting.", "Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.", "\"The man's cub--the man's cub?\" he said. \"I speak for the man's cub. There is no harm in a man's cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.\"", "\"We need yet another,\" said Akela. \"Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?\"", "\"Good! Good!\" said the young wolves, who are always hungry. \"Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.\"", "\"Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.\"", "\"Speak then,\" cried twenty voices.", "\"To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo's word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man's cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?\"", "\"Ay, roar well,\" said Bagheera, under his whiskers, \"for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.\"", "\"It was well done,\" said Akela. \"Men and their cubs are very wise. He may be a help in time.\"", "\"Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,\" said Bagheera.", "Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up--to be killed in his turn.", "\"Take him away,\" he said to Father Wolf, \"and train him as befits one of the Free People.\"", "And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Baloo's good word.", "And he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that he is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think of except things to eat.", "\"As many times as there are nuts on that palm,\" said Mowgli, who, naturally, could not count. \"What of it? I am sleepy, Bagheera, and Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock.\"", "\"But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the Pack know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has told thee too.\"", "\"Ho! ho!\" said Mowgli. \"Tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude talk that I was a naked man's cub and not fit to dig pig-nuts. But I caught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palm-tree to teach him better manners.\"", "\"And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?\" said Mowgli. \"I was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the Law of the Jungle, and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have not pulled a thorn. Surely they are my brothers!\"", "Bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes. \"Little Brother,\" said he, \"feel under my jaw.\"", "Mowgli put up his strong brown hand, and just under Bagheera's silky chin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair, he came upon a little bald spot.", "\"Yes,\" said Mowgli, \"all the jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli.\"", "\"Oh, thou art a man's cub,\" said the Black Panther very tenderly. \"And even as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back to men at last--to the men who are thy brothers--if thou art not killed in the Council.\"", "\"But why--but why should any wish to kill me?\" said Mowgli.", "\"Look at me,\" said Bagheera. And Mowgli looked at him steadily between the eyes. The big panther turned his head away in half a minute.", "\"I did not know these things,\" said Mowgli sullenly, and he frowned under his heavy black eyebrows.", "By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the jungle will call fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in deadly fear of it, and invents a hundred ways of describing it.", "\"The Red Flower?\" said Mowgli. \"That grows outside their huts in the twilight. I will get some.\"", "\"There speaks the man's cub,\" said Bagheera proudly. \"Remember that it grows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and keep it by thee for time of need.\"", "\"Good!\" said Mowgli. \"I go. But art thou sure, O my Bagheera\"--he slipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big eyes--\"art thou sure that all this is Shere Khan's doing?\"", "\"By the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.\"", "\"Then, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan full tale for this, and it may be a little over,\" said Mowgli, and he bounded away.", "\"That is a man. That is all a man,\" said Bagheera to himself, lying down again. \"Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunting than that frog-hunt of thine ten years ago!\"", "Mowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, and his heart was hot in him. He came to the cave as the evening mist rose, and drew breath, and looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but Mother Wolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his breathing that something was troubling her frog.", "The Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for Mowgli heard the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him over with his forefoot.", "He did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the yells grew fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers lived.", "\"Bagheera spoke truth,\" he panted, as he nestled down in some cattle fodder by the window of a hut. \"To-morrow is one day both for Akela and for me.\"", "\"Is that all?\" said Mowgli. \"If a cub can do it, there is nothing to fear.\" So he strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot from his hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear.", "\"They are very like me,\" said Mowgli, blowing into the pot as he had seen the woman do. \"This thing will die if I do not give it things to eat\"; and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up the hill he met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his coat.", "\"Akela has missed,\" said the Panther. \"They would have killed him last night, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on the hill.\"", "\"I was among the plowed lands. I am ready. See!\" Mowgli held up the fire-pot.", "\"Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and presently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not afraid?\"", "\"No. Why should I fear? I remember now--if it is not a dream--how, before I was a Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and pleasant.\"", "\"He has no right,\" whispered Bagheera. \"Say so. He is a dog's son. He will be frightened.\"", "Mowgli sprang to his feet. \"Free People,\" he cried, \"does Shere Khan lead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?\"", "\"Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to speak--\" Shere Khan began.", "\"By whom?\" said Mowgli. \"Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle butcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.\"", "There were yells of \"Silence, thou man's cub!\" \"Let him speak. He has kept our Law\"; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: \"Let the Dead Wolf speak.\" When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill, he is called the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long.", "Akela raised his old head wearily:--", "Then more than half the Pack yelled: \"A man! A man! What has a man to do with us? Let him go to his own place.\"", "\"And turn all the people of the villages against us?\" clamored Shere Khan. \"No, give him to me. He is a man, and none of us can look him between the eyes.\"", "Akela lifted his head again and said, \"He has eaten our food. He has slept with us. He has driven game for us. He has broken no word of the Law of the Jungle.\"", "\"Also, I paid for him with a bull when he was accepted. The worth of a bull is little, but Bagheera's honor is something that he will perhaps fight for,\" said Bagheera in his gentlest voice.", "\"A bull paid ten years ago!\" the Pack snarled. \"What do we care for bones ten years old?\"", "\"Or for a pledge?\" said Bagheera, his white teeth bared under his lip. \"Well are ye called the Free People!\"", "\"No man's cub can run with the people of the jungle,\" howled Shere Khan. \"Give him to me!\"", "\"He is a man--a man--a man!\" snarled the Pack. And most of the wolves began to gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to switch.", "\"Now the business is in thy hands,\" said Bagheera to Mowgli. \"We can do no more except fight.\"", "He flung the fire pot on the ground, and some of the red coals lit a tuft of dried moss that flared up, as all the Council drew back in terror before the leaping flames.", "Mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and crackled, and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves.", "\"Thou art the master,\" said Bagheera in an undertone. \"Save Akela from the death. He was ever thy friend.\"", "Akela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that made the shadows jump and quiver.", "Shere Khan's ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his eyes, for the blazing branch was very near.", "\"What is it? What is it?\" he said. \"I do not wish to leave the jungle, and I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?\"", "\"Now,\" he said, \"I will go to men. But first I must say farewell to my mother.\" And he went to the cave where she lived with Father Wolf, and he cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably.", "\"Ye will not forget me?\" said Mowgli.", "\"Never while we can follow a trail,\" said the cubs. \"Come to the foot of the hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee; and we will come into the croplands to play with thee by night.\"", "\"Come soon!\" said Father Wolf. \"Oh, wise little frog, come again soon; for we be old, thy mother and I.\"", "\"Come soon,\" said Mother Wolf, \"little naked son of mine. For, listen, child of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs.\"", "\"I will surely come,\" said Mowgli. \"And when I come it will be to lay out Shere Khan's hide upon the Council Rock. Do not forget me! Tell them in the jungle never to forget me!\"", "The dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the hillside alone, to meet those mysterious things that are called men.", "Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack", "As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled     Once, twice and again!   And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up   From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.   This I, scouting alone, beheld,     Once, twice and again!", "As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled     Once, twice and again!   And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back   To carry the word to the waiting pack,   And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track     Once, twice and again!", "As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled     Once, twice and again!   Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!", "Eyes that can see in the dark--the dark!   Tongue--give tongue to it! Hark! O hark!     Once, twice and again!", "All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times. But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a temper, \"A man's cub is a man's cub, and he must learn all the Law of the Jungle.\"", "\"But think how small he is,\" said the Black Panther, who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own way. \"How can his little head carry all thy long talk?\"", "\"Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No. That is why I teach him these things, and that is why I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.\"", "\"Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?\" Bagheera grunted. \"His face is all bruised today by thy--softness. Ugh.\"", "\"I will call Mowgli and he shall say them--if he will. Come, Little Brother!\"", "\"My head is ringing like a bee tree,\" said a sullen little voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the ground: \"I come for Bagheera and not for thee, fat old Baloo!\"", "\"That is all one to me,\" said Baloo, though he was hurt and grieved. \"Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of the Jungle that I have taught thee this day.\"", "\"Master Words for which people?\" said Mowgli, delighted to show off. \"The jungle has many tongues. I know them all.\"", "\"A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera, they never thank their teacher. Not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank old Baloo for his teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People, then--great scholar.\"", "\"We be of one blood, ye and I,\" said Mowgli, giving the words the Bear accent which all the Hunting People use.", "Mowgli repeated, with the Kite's whistle at the end of the sentence.", "\"Now for the Snake-People,\" said Bagheera.", "The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his feet behind, clapped his hands together to applaud himself, and jumped on to Bagheera's back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at Baloo.", "\"No one then is to be feared,\" Baloo wound up, patting his big furry stomach with pride.", "\"Except his own tribe,\" said Bagheera, under his breath; and then aloud to Mowgli, \"Have a care for my ribs, Little Brother! What is all this dancing up and down?\"", "Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at Bagheera's shoulder fur and kicking hard. When the two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his voice, \"And so I shall have a tribe of my own, and lead them through the branches all day long.\"", "\"What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?\" said Bagheera.", "\"Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,\" Mowgli went on. \"They have promised me this. Ah!\"", "\"Whoof!\" Baloo's big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera's back, and as the boy lay between the big fore-paws he could see the Bear was angry.", "\"Mowgli,\" said Baloo, \"thou hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the Monkey People.\"", "Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too, and Bagheera's eyes were as hard as jade stones.", "\"Thou hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people without a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame.\"", "\"When Baloo hurt my head,\" said Mowgli (he was still on his back), \"I went away, and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on me. No one else cared.\" He snuffled a little.", "\"The pity of the Monkey People!\" Baloo snorted. \"The stillness of the mountain stream! The cool of the summer sun! And then, man-cub?\"", "\"And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat, and they--they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said I was their blood brother except that I had no tail, and should be their leader some day.\"", "\"They have no leader,\" said Bagheera. \"They lie. They have always lied.\"", "\"They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken among the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do not hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up! Bad Baloo, let me up! I will play with them again.\"", "\"No,\" said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo had finished.", "\"The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds. They are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they have any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we do not notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads.\"", "He had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down through the branches; and they could hear coughings and howlings and angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches.", "\"The Monkey-People are forbidden,\" said Baloo, \"forbidden to the Jungle-People. Remember.\"", "\"Forbidden,\" said Bagheera, \"but I still think Baloo should have warned thee against them.\"", "\"I--I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey People! Faugh!\"", "\"In whose name, Brother?\" Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of course he had heard of him.", "\"Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my trail!\"", "The last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air, but Rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust, and there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the treetops as Mowgli's escort whirled along.", "\"They never go far,\" he said with a chuckle. \"They never do what they set out to do. Always pecking at new things are the Bandar-log. This time, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for themselves, for Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know, kill more than goats.\"", "So he rocked on his wings, his feet gathered up under him, and waited.", "Meantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera climbed as he had never climbed before, but the thin branches broke beneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws full of bark.", "\"Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?\" he roared to poor Baloo, who had set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys. \"What was the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him?\"", "\"Haste! O haste! We--we may catch them yet!\" Baloo panted.", "\"At that speed! It would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the Law--cub-beater--a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee open. Sit still and think! Make a plan. This is no time for chasing. They may drop him if we follow too close.\"", "Baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning.", "\"At least he gave me all the Words correctly a little time ago,\" said Bagheera impatiently. \"Baloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect. What would the jungle think if I, the Black Panther, curled myself up like Ikki the Porcupine, and howled?\"", "\"What do I care what the jungle thinks? He may be dead by now.\"", "\"What will he do for us? He is not of our tribe, being footless--and with most evil eyes,\" said Bagheera.", "\"He is very old and very cunning. Above all, he is always hungry,\" said Baloo hopefully. \"Promise him many goats.\"", "\"He sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten. He may be asleep now, and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats?\" Bagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious.", "\"Then in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might make him see reason.\" Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the Panther, and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.", "\"He has not eaten,\" said Baloo, with a grunt of relief, as soon as he saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket. \"Be careful, Bagheera! He is always a little blind after he has changed his skin, and very quick to strike.\"", "\"Good hunting for us all,\" he answered. \"Oho, Baloo, what dost thou do here? Good hunting, Bagheera. One of us at least needs food. Is there any news of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young buck? I am as empty as a dried well.\"", "\"We are hunting,\" said Baloo carelessly. He knew that you must not hurry Kaa. He is too big.", "\"Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,\" said Baloo.", "\"Footless, yellow earth-worm,\" said Bagheera under his whiskers, as though he were trying to remember something.", "\"Sssss! Have they ever called me that?\" said Kaa.", "Now a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows that he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see the big swallowing muscles on either side of Kaa's throat ripple and bulge.", "\"The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds,\" he said quietly. \"When I came up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops.\"", "\"It--it is the Bandar-log that we follow now,\" said Baloo, but the words stuck in his throat, for that was the first time in his memory that one of the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the monkeys.", "\"Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such hunters--leaders in their own jungle I am certain--on the trail of the Bandar-log,\" Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled with curiosity.", "\"Indeed,\" Baloo began, \"I am no more than the old and sometimes very foolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera here--\"", "\"Is Bagheera,\" said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with a snap, for he did not believe in being humble. \"The trouble is this, Kaa. Those nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of whom thou hast perhaps heard.\"", "\"I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told.\"", "\"But it is true. He is such a man-cub as never was,\" said Baloo. \"The best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides, I--we--love him, Kaa.\"", "\"Ts! Ts!\" said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro. \"I also have known what love is. There are tales I could tell that--\"", "\"That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly,\" said Bagheera quickly. \"Our man-cub is in the hands of the Bandar-log now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone.\"", "\"Worm--worm--earth-worm,\" said Bagheera, \"as well as other things which I cannot now say for shame.\"", "\"We must remind them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp! We must help their wandering memories. Now, whither went they with the cub?\"", "\"The jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe,\" said Baloo. \"We had thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa.\"", "\"I? How? I take them when they come in my way, but I do not hunt the Bandar-log, or frogs--or green scum on a water-hole, for that matter.\"", "\"Up, Up! Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo of the Seeonee Wolf Pack!\"", "Baloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there was Rann the Kite, sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his wings. It was near Rann's bedtime, but he had ranged all over the jungle looking for the Bear and had missed him in the thick foliage.", "\"Full gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann,\" cried Bagheera. \"I will remember thee in my next kill, and put aside the head for thee alone, O best of kites!\"", "\"It is nothing. It is nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could have done no less,\" and Rann circled up again to his roost.", "\"He has not forgotten to use his tongue,\" said Baloo with a chuckle of pride. \"To think of one so young remembering the Master Word for the birds too while he was being pulled across trees!\"", "\"It was most firmly driven into him,\" said Bagheera. \"But I am proud of him, and now we must go to the Cold Lairs.\"", "\"It is half a night's journey--at full speed,\" said Bagheera, and Baloo looked very serious. \"I will go as fast as I can,\" he said anxiously.", "\"We dare not wait for thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go on the quick-foot--Kaa and I.\"", "\"By the Broken Lock that freed me,\" said Bagheera, when twilight had fallen, \"thou art no slow goer!\"", "\"I am hungry,\" said Kaa. \"Besides, they called me speckled frog.\"", "\"Worm--earth-worm, and yellow to boot.\"", "\"All one. Let us go on,\" and Kaa seemed to pour himself along the ground, finding the shortest road with his steady eyes, and keeping to it.", "\"I wish to eat,\" said Mowgli. \"I am a stranger in this part of the jungle. Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here.\"", "\"I will go to the west wall,\" Kaa whispered, \"and come down swiftly with the slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon my back in their hundreds, but--\"", "\"I know it,\" said Bagheera. \"Would that Baloo were here, but we must do what we can. When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace. They hold some sort of council there over the boy.\"", "\"Stay there,\" shouted the monkeys, \"till we have killed thy friends, and later we will play with thee--if the Poison-People leave thee alive.\"", "\"We be of one blood, ye and I,\" said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snake's Call. He could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him and gave the Call a second time, to make sure.", "\"Even ssso! Down hoods all!\" said half a dozen low voices (every ruin in India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes, and the old summerhouse was alive with cobras). \"Stand still, Little Brother, for thy feet may do us harm.\"", "\"Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone,\" Mowgli thought. And then he called aloud: \"To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the water tanks. Roll and plunge! Get to the water!\"", "\"Get the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more,\" Bagheera gasped. \"Let us take the man-cub and go. They may attack again.\"", "\"They will not move till I order them. Stay you sssso!\" Kaa hissed, and the city was silent once more. \"I could not come before, Brother, but I think I heard thee call\"--this was to Bagheera.", "\"I--I may have cried out in the battle,\" Bagheera answered. \"Baloo, art thou hurt?", "\"I am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little bearlings,\" said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other. \"Wow! I am sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera and I.\"", "\"No matter. Where is the manling?\"", "\"Here, in a trap. I cannot climb out,\" cried Mowgli. The curve of the broken dome was above his head.", "\"Take him away. He dances like Mao the Peacock. He will crush our young,\" said the cobras inside.", "\"Hah!\" said Kaa with a chuckle, \"he has friends everywhere, this manling. Stand back, manling. And hide you, O Poison People. I break down the wall.\"", "\"Art thou hurt?\" said Baloo, hugging him softly.", "\"I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they have handled ye grievously, my Brothers! Ye bleed.\"", "\"Others also,\" said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at the monkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.", "\"It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all little frogs!\" whimpered Baloo.", "\"Of that we shall judge later,\" said Bagheera, in a dry voice that Mowgli did not at all like. \"But here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle and thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our customs, Mowgli.\"", "Mowgli turned and saw the great Python's head swaying a foot above his own.", "\"So this is the manling,\" said Kaa. \"Very soft is his skin, and he is not unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake thee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed my coat.\"", "\"We be one blood, thou and I,\" Mowgli answered. \"I take my life from thee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.\"", "\"All thanks, Little Brother,\" said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. \"And what may so bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow when next he goes abroad.\"", "\"The moon sets,\" he said. \"Is there yet light enough to see?\"", "From the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops--\"We see, O Kaa.\"", "\"Good. Begins now the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still and watch.\"", "Baloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their throats, their neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched and wondered.", "\"Bandar-log,\" said the voice of Kaa at last, \"can ye stir foot or hand without my order? Speak!\"", "\"Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!\"", "\"Good! Come all one pace nearer to me.\"", "The lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and Bagheera took one stiff step forward with them.", "\"Nearer!\" hissed Kaa, and they all moved again.", "Mowgli laid his hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the two great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream.", "\"Keep thy hand on my shoulder,\" Bagheera whispered. \"Keep it there, or I must go back--must go back to Kaa. Aah!\"", "\"It is only old Kaa making circles on the dust,\" said Mowgli. \"Let us go.\" And the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle.", "\"Whoof!\" said Baloo, when he stood under the still trees again. \"Never more will I make an ally of Kaa,\" and he shook himself all over.", "\"He knows more than we,\" said Bagheera, trembling. \"In a little time, had I stayed, I should have walked down his throat.\"", "\"Many will walk by that road before the moon rises again,\" said Baloo. \"He will have good hunting--after his own fashion.\"", "\"But what was the meaning of it all?\" said Mowgli, who did not know anything of a python's powers of fascination. \"I saw no more than a big snake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his nose was all sore. Ho! Ho!\"", "\"Mowgli,\" said Bagheera angrily, \"his nose was sore on thy account, as my ears and sides and paws, and Baloo's neck and shoulders are bitten on thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be able to hunt with pleasure for many days.\"", "\"It is nothing,\" said Baloo; \"we have the man-cub again.\"", "\"True, it is true,\" said Mowgli sorrowfully. \"I am an evil man-cub, and my stomach is sad in me.\"", "\"Mf! What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?\"", "Baloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he could not tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: \"Sorrow never stays punishment. But remember, Bagheera, he is very little.\"", "\"I will remember. But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now. Mowgli, hast thou anything to say?\"", "\"Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded. It is just.\"", "Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther's point of view (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could wish to avoid. When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself up without a word.", "\"Now,\" said Bagheera, \"jump on my back, Little Brother, and we will go home.\"", "One of the beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles all scores. There is no nagging afterward.", "Mowgli laid his head down on Bagheera's back and slept so deeply that he never waked when he was put down in the home-cave.", "All the talk we ever have heard   Uttered by bat or beast or bird--   Hide or fin or scale or feather--   Jabber it quickly and all together!   Excellent! Wonderful! Once again!", "Now we are talking just like men!     Let's pretend we are ... never mind,     Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!     This is the way of the Monkey-kind.", "Then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines,   That rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape swings.   By the rubbish in our wake, and the noble noise we make,   Be sure, be sure, we're going to do some splendid things!", "\"They have no manners, these Men Folk,\" said Mowgli to himself. \"Only the gray ape would behave as they do.\" So he threw back his long hair and frowned at the crowd.", "\"What is there to be afraid of?\" said the priest. \"Look at the marks on his arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He is but a wolf-child run away from the jungle.\"", "Of course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli harder than they intended, and there were white scars all over his arms and legs. But he would have been the last person in the world to call these bites, for he knew what real biting meant.", "\"Arre! Arre!\" said two or three women together. \"To be bitten by wolves, poor child! He is a handsome boy. He has eyes like red fire. By my honor, Messua, he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger.\"", "\"Let me look,\" said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles, and she peered at Mowgli under the palm of her hand. \"Indeed he is not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy.\"", "\"By the Bull that bought me,\" said Mowgli to himself, \"but all this talking is like another looking-over by the Pack! Well, if I am a man, a man I must become.\"", "So Mowgli stretched himself in some long, clean grass at the edge of the field, but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him under the chin.", "\"Phew!\" said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolf's cubs). \"This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest of wood smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already. Wake, Little Brother; I bring news.\"", "\"Are all well in the jungle?\" said Mowgli, hugging him.", "\"All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now, listen. Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows again, for he is badly singed. When he returns he swears that he will lay thy bones in the Waingunga.\"", "\"There are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But news is always good. I am tired to-night,--very tired with new things, Gray Brother,--but bring me the news always.\"", "\"Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee forget?\" said Gray Brother anxiously.", "\"Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave. But also I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack.\"", "\"And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men, Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When I come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge of the grazing-ground.\"", "He did not know his own strength in the least. In the jungle he knew he was weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people said that he was as strong as a bull.", "Mowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of, had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo, the Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful story to another, and Mowgli's shoulders shook.", "\"True, true, that must be the truth,\" said the gray-beards, nodding together.", "\"Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?\" said Mowgli. \"That tiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows. To talk of the soul of a money-lender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal is child's talk.\"", "Buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment, and the head-man stared.", "\"Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?\" said Buldeo. \"If thou art so wise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set a hundred rupees on his life. Better still, talk not when thy elders speak.\"", "\"It is full time that boy went to herding,\" said the head-man, while Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli's impertinence.", "\"It is an order,\" said Mowgli. \"I am a village herd for a while. What news of Shere Khan?\"", "\"He has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for thee. Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means to kill thee.\"", "\"Very good,\" said Mowgli. \"So long as he is away do thou or one of the four brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of the village. When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak tree in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khan's mouth.\"", "At last a day came when he did not see Gray Brother at the signal place, and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree, which was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother, every bristle on his back lifted.", "\"He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard. He crossed the ranges last night with Tabaqui, hot-foot on thy trail,\" said the Wolf, panting.", "Mowgli frowned. \"I am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is very cunning.\"", "\"Has he eaten today, or does he hunt empty?\" said Mowgli, for the answer meant life and death to him.", "\"He killed at dawn,--a pig,--and he has drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan could never fast, even for the sake of revenge.\"", "\"He swam far down the Waingunga to cut that off,\" said Gray Brother.", "\"Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.\" Gray Brother trotted off and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray head that Mowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry of all the jungle--the hunting howl of a wolf at midday.", "\"Akela! Akela!\" said Mowgli, clapping his hands. \"I might have known that thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand. Cut the herd in two, Akela. Keep the cows and calves together, and the bulls and the plow buffaloes by themselves.\"", "\"What orders!\" panted Akela. \"They are trying to join again.\"", "Mowgli slipped on to Rama's back. \"Drive the bulls away to the left, Akela. Gray Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and drive them into the foot of the ravine.\"", "\"How far?\" said Gray Brother, panting and snapping.", "\"Well done! Another charge and they are fairly started. Careful, now--careful, Akela. A snap too much and the bulls will charge. Hujah! This is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou think these creatures could move so swiftly?\" Mowgli called.", "\"I have--have hunted these too in my time,\" gasped Akela in the dust. \"Shall I turn them into the jungle?\"", "\"Ay! Turn. Swiftly turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I could only tell him what I need of him to-day.\"", "The bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the standing thicket. The other herd children, watching with the cattle half a mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry them, crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away.", "\"Let them breathe, Akela,\" he said, holding up his hand. \"They have not winded him yet. Let them breathe. I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We have him in the trap.\"", "He put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine--it was almost like shouting down a tunnel--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock.", "After a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a full-fed tiger just wakened.", "\"Who calls?\" said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of the ravine screeching.", "\"I, Mowgli.

He was dead, and the kites were coming for him already.", "\"Brothers, that was a dog's death,\" said Mowgli, feeling for the knife he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men. \"But he would never have shown fight. His hide will look well on the Council Rock. We must get to work swiftly.\"", "\"Hum!\" said Mowgli, half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a forepaw. \"So thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward, and perhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in my mind that I need the skin for my own use. Heh! Old man, take away that fire!\"", "\"By the Bull that bought me,\" said Mowgli, who was trying to get at the shoulder, \"must I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela, this man plagues me.\"", "Buldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan's head, found himself sprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him, while Mowgli went on skinning as though he were alone in all India.", "\"Ye-es,\" he said, between his teeth. \"Thou art altogether right, Buldeo. Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an old war between this lame tiger and myself--a very old war, and--I have won.\"", "\"Maharaj! Great King,\" he said at last in a husky whisper.", "\"Yes,\" said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling a little.", "\"I am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a herdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to pieces?\"", "\"Go, and peace go with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my game. Let him go, Akela.\"", "Buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could, looking back over his shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible. When he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look very grave.", "Mowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly twilight before he and the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body.", "\"Now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home! Help me to herd them, Akela.\"", "The old Tower musket went off with a bang, and a young buffalo bellowed in pain.", "\"More sorcery!\" shouted the villagers. \"He can turn bullets. Buldeo, that was thy buffalo.\"", "\"Now what is this?\" said Mowgli, bewildered, as the stones flew thicker.", "\"They are not unlike the Pack, these brothers of thine,\" said Akela, sitting down composedly. \"It is in my head that, if bullets mean anything, they would cast thee out.\"", "\"Wolf! Wolf's cub! Go away!\" shouted the priest, waving a sprig of the sacred tulsi plant.", "\"Again? Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because I am a wolf. Let us go, Akela.\"", "A woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: \"Oh, my son, my son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast at will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee.

They hardly needed Akela's yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind, scattering the crowd right and left.", "\"Keep count!\" shouted Mowgli scornfully. \"It may be that I have stolen one of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more. Fare you well, children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come in with my wolves and hunt you up and down your street.\"", "He turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf, and as he looked up at the stars he felt happy. \"No more sleeping in traps for me, Akela. Let us get Shere Khan's skin and go away. No, we will not hurt the village, for Messua was kind to me.\"", "The moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to the hill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf's cave.", "\"They have cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother,\" shouted Mowgli, \"but I come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word.\"", "Mother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her, and her eyes glowed as she saw the skin.", "\"I told him on that day, when he crammed his head and shoulders into this cave, hunting for thy life, Little Frog--I told him that the hunter would be the hunted.

Where have you been?\"", "It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four months he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad.

You look as though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.\"", "\"I haven't been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The beach is disgracefully crowded this season.

Ho! Hmph! What's that?\" said Sea Vitch, and he struck the next walrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up, and the next struck the next, and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction but the right one.", "\"Hi!

Stareek!\"", "And Kotick curled up his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, \"I am the only white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the only seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.\"", "\"By the Great Combers of Magellan!\" he said, beneath his mustache. \"Who in the Deep Sea are these people?\"", "\"Well!\" said Kotick. \"You're the only people I've ever met uglier than Sea Vitch--and with worse manners.\"", "Then he remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed to him when he was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled backward in the water, for he knew that he had found Sea Cow at last.", "\"My wig!\" he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at the farther end. \"It was a long dive, but it was worth it.\"", "\"It's Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,\" said Kotick. \"Sea Cow must be wiser than I thought. Men can't come down the cliffs, even if there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to splinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.\"", "He began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was in a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new country, so that he would be able to answer all questions.", "Then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced through to the southward. No one but a sea cow or a seal would have dreamed of there being such a place, and when he looked back at the cliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them.", "He was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when he hauled out just above Sea Lion's Neck the first person he met was the seal who had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes that he had found his island at last.", "The other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his head from side to side. He had just married that year, and was making a great fuss about it.", "\"I've no nursery to fight for,\" said Kotick. \"I only want to show you all a place where you will be safe. What's the use of fighting?\"", "\"Oh, if you're trying to back out, of course I've no more to say,\" said the young seal with an ugly chuckle.", "\"Will you come with me if I win?\" said Kotick. And a green light came into his eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all.", "\"Very good,\" said the young seal carelessly. \"If you win, I'll come.\"", "At night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through the fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. \"Now,\" he said, \"I've taught you your lesson.\"", "\"My wig!\" said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was fearfully mauled. \"The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up worse. Son, I'm proud of you, and what's more, I'll come with you to your island--if there is such a place.\"", "\"Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who comes with me to the Sea Cow's tunnel? Answer, or I shall teach you again,\" roared Kotick.", "There was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the beaches. \"We will come,\" said thousands of tired voices. \"We will follow Kotick, the White Seal.\"", "Then Kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes proudly. He was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail. All the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his wounds.", "This is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when they are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of very sad seal National Anthem.", "I met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!)

He's tickling under my chin,\" said Teddy.", "Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy's collar and neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.", "\"Good gracious,\" said Teddy's mother, \"and that's a wild creature! I suppose he's so tame because we've been kind to him.\"", "\"All mongooses are like that,\" said her husband. \"If Teddy doesn't pick him up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage, he'll run in and out of the house all day long. Let's give him something to eat.\"", "They gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it immensely, and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then he felt better.", "\"There are more things to find out about in this house,\" he said to himself, \"than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall certainly stay and find out.\"", "But Teddy's mother wouldn't think of anything so awful.", "It was Darzee, the Tailorbird, and his wife.

He knew that mongooses in the garden meant death sooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to get Rikki-tikki off his guard. So he dropped his head a little, and put it on one side.", "\"Let us talk,\" he said. \"You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?\"", "\"Behind you! Look behind you!\" sang Darzee.", "\"Wicked, wicked Darzee!\" said Nag, lashing up as high as he could reach toward the nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach of snakes, and it only swayed to and fro.", "\"Don't kill me,\" said Chuchundra, almost weeping. \"Rikki-tikki, don't kill me!\"", "\"Do you think a snake-killer kills muskrats?\" said Rikki-tikki scornfully.", "\"Those who kill snakes get killed by snakes,\" said Chuchundra, more sorrowfully than ever. \"And how am I to be sure that Nag won't mistake me for you some dark night?\"", "\"There's not the least danger,\" said Rikki-tikki. \"But Nag is in the garden, and I know you don't go there.\"", "\"My cousin Chua, the rat, told me--\" said Chuchundra, and then he stopped.", "\"H'sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua in the garden.\"", "\"I didn't--so you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I'll bite you!\"", "Chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers. \"I am a very poor man,\" he sobbed. \"I never had spirit enough to run out into the middle of the room. H'sh! I mustn't tell you anything. Can't you hear, Rikki-tikki?\"", "Rikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he thought he could just catch the faintest scratch-scratch in the world--a noise as faint as that of a wasp walking on a window-pane--the dry scratch of a snake's scales on brick-work.", "\"That's Nag or Nagaina,\" he said to himself, \"and he is crawling into the bath-room sluice. You're right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to Chua.\"", "\"When the house is emptied of people,\" said Nagaina to her husband, \"he will have to go away, and then the garden will be our own again. Go in quietly, and remember that the big man who killed Karait is the first one to bite. Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt for Rikki-tikki together.\"", "\"But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the people?\" said Nag.", "\"Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any mongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king and queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the melon bed hatch (as they may tomorrow), our children will need room and quiet.\"", "\"I had not thought of that,\" said Nag. \"I will go, but there is no need that we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the big man and his wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly.

And, when I am once there, I must not let go.\"", "Rikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut, for now he was quite sure he was dead. But the head did not move, and the big man picked him up and said, \"It's the mongoose again, Alice. The little chap has saved our lives now.\"", "Then Teddy's mother came in with a very white face, and saw what was left of Nag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddy's bedroom and spent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out whether he really was broken into forty pieces, as he fancied.", "When morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his doings. \"Now I have Nagaina to settle with, and she will be worse than five Nags, and there's no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch. Goodness! I must go and see Darzee,\" he said.", "Without waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush where Darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice. The news of Nag's death was all over the garden, for the sweeper had thrown the body on the rubbish-heap.", "\"Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers!\" said Rikki-tikki angrily. \"Is this the time to sing?\"", "\"Nag is dead--is dead--is dead!\" sang Darzee. \"The valiant Rikki-tikki caught him by the head and held fast. The big man brought the bang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He will never eat my babies again.\"", "\"All that's true enough. But where's Nagaina?\" said Rikki-tikki, looking carefully round him.", "\"Nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag,\" Darzee went on, \"and Nag came out on the end of a stick--the sweeper picked him up on the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap. Let us sing about the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!\" And Darzee filled his throat and sang.", "\"If I could get up to your nest, I'd roll your babies out!\" said Rikki-tikki. \"You don't know when to do the right thing at the right time. You're safe enough in your nest there, but it's war for me down here. Stop singing a minute, Darzee.\"", "\"For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki's sake I will stop,\" said Darzee. \"What is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?\"", "\"Where is Nagaina, for the third time?\"", "\"On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is Rikki-tikki with the white teeth.\"", "\"Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?\"", "\"In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes nearly all day. She hid them there weeks ago.\"", "\"And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the wall, you said?\"", "\"Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?\"", "\"Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina chase you away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went there now she'd see me.\"", "She fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out, \"Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and broke it.\" Then she fluttered more desperately than ever.", "Nagaina lifted up her head and hissed, \"You warned Rikki-tikki when I would have killed him. Indeed and truly, you've chosen a bad place to be lame in.\" And she moved toward Darzee's wife, slipping along over the dust.", "\"The boy broke it with a stone!\" shrieked Darzee's wife.", "Darzee's wife knew better than to do that, for a bird who looks at a snake's eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzee's wife fluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and Nagaina quickened her pace.", "Rikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he raced for the end of the melon patch near the wall. There, in the warm litter above the melons, very cunningly hidden, he found twenty-five eggs, about the size of a bantam's eggs, but with whitish skin instead of shell.", "\"Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she has gone into the veranda, and--oh, come quickly--she means killing!\"", "\"Son of the big man that killed Nag,\" she hissed, \"stay still. I am not ready yet. Wait a little. Keep very still, all you three! If you move I strike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed my Nag!\"", "Teddy's eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do was to whisper, \"Sit still, Teddy. You mustn't move. Teddy, keep still.\"", "Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, \"Turn round, Nagaina. Turn and fight!\"", "\"All in good time,\" said she, without moving her eyes. \"I will settle my account with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are still and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a step nearer I strike.\"", "\"Look at your eggs,\" said Rikki-tikki, \"in the melon bed near the wall. Go and look, Nagaina!\"", "The big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda. \"Ah-h! Give it to me,\" she said.", "Rikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes were blood-red. \"What price for a snake's egg? For a young cobra? For a young king cobra? For the last--the very last of the brood? The ants are eating all the others down by the melon bed.\"", "Nagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one egg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddy's father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy by the shoulder, and drag him across the little table with the tea-cups, safe and out of reach of Nagaina.", "Nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg lay between Rikki-tikki's paws. \"Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me the last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back,\" she said, lowering her hood.", "\"Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back. For you will go to the rubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his gun! Fight!\"", "Then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said, \"It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant Rikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely kill him underground.\"", "Rikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was--slept and slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he had done a hard day's work.", "\"Now,\" he said, when he awoke, \"I will go back to the house. Tell the Coppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell the garden that Nagaina is dead.\"", "\"He saved our lives and Teddy's life,\" she said to her husband. \"Just think, he saved all our lives.\"", "Rikki-tikki woke up with a jump, for the mongooses are light sleepers.", "\"Oh, it's you,\" said he. \"What are you bothering for? All the cobras are dead. And if they weren't, I'm here.\"", "Rikki-tikki had a right to be proud of himself. But he did not grow too proud, and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it, with tooth and jump and spring and bite, till never a cobra dared show its head inside the walls.", "(Sung in honor of Rikki-tikki-tavi)", "Singer and tailor am I--     Doubled the joys that I know--   Proud of my lilt to the sky,     Proud of the house that I sew--   Over and under, so weave I my music--so weave I the house that I     sew.", "Sing to your fledglings again,     Mother, oh lift up your head!   Evil that plagued us is slain,     Death in the garden lies dead.   Terror that hid in the roses is impotent--flung on the dung-hill   and dead!", "Who has delivered us, who?

I will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugar-cane:     I will go out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their lairs.", "I will go out until the day, until the morning break--     Out to the wind's untainted kiss, the water's clean caress;   I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my picket stake.     I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates masterless!", "\"Yes,\" said Little Toomai, \"he is afraid of me,\" and he took long strides up to Kala Nag, called him a fat old pig, and made him lift up his feet one after the other.", "Little Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing. He very much preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat roads, with the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve, and the long hours when there was nothing to do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in his pickets.", "\"What--what will happen?\" said Little Toomai.", "Big Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him, and Machua Appa, the head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his, \"There goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least. 'Tis a pity to send that young jungle-cock to molt in the plains.\"", "\"This is not a man, but a boy. He went into the Keddah at the last drive, and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that young calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother.\"", "Machua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and Little Toomai bowed to the earth.", "\"He throw a rope? He is smaller than a picket-pin. Little one, what is thy name?\" said Petersen Sahib.", "\"Oho!\" said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, \"and why didst thou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal green corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to dry?\"", "\"He is Toomai, my son, Sahib,\" said Big Toomai, scowling. \"He is a very bad boy, and he will end in a jail, Sahib.\"", "\"Must I never go there, Sahib?\" asked Little Toomai with a big gasp.", "\"Yes.\" Petersen Sahib smiled again. \"When thou hast seen the elephants dance. That is the proper time. Come to me when thou hast seen the elephants dance, and then I will let thee go into all the Keddahs.\"", "Big Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he was very angry, but Little Toomai was too happy to speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him, and given him money, so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he had been called out of the ranks and praised by his commander-in-chief.", "\"What did Petersen Sahib mean by the elephant dance?\" he said, at last, softly to his mother.", "Big Toomai heard him and grunted. \"That thou shouldst never be one of these hill buffaloes of trackers. That was what he meant. Oh, you in front, what is blocking the way?\"", "\"What will they do?\" Little Toomai called out.", "\"Ohe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast a cool head. They will dance, and it behooves thy father, who has swept all the hills of all the elephants, to double-chain his pickets to-night.\"", "\"What talk is this?\" said Big Toomai. \"For forty years, father and son, we have tended elephants, and we have never heard such moonshine about dances.\"", "And in this way, talking and wrangling and splashing through the rivers, they made their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new elephants. But they lost their tempers long before they got there.", "\"Ai!\" he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. \"The elephant-folk are out tonight. It is the dance, then!\"", "They were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground in couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves--scores and scores of elephants.", "At last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest, and Kala Nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into the middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants began to talk in their own tongue, and to move about.", "\"Wah!\" said Little Toomai, and his eyes were very heavy. \"Kala Nag, my lord, let us keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib's camp, or I shall drop from thy neck.\"", "The third elephant watched the two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and took his own path. He may have belonged to some little native king's establishment, fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away.", "\"The child speaks truth,\" said he. \"All this was done last night, and I have counted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where Pudmini's leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was there too.\"", "They looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the ways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to fathom.", "\"Forty years and five,\" said Machua Appa, \"have I followed my lord, the elephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what this child has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is--what can we say?\" and he shook his head.", "When they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. Petersen Sahib ate alone in his tent, but he gave orders that the camp should have two sheep and some fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and rice and salt, for he knew that there would be a feast.", "And at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the tips touched their foreheads, and broke out into the full salute--the crashing trumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut of the Keddah.", "But it was all for the sake of Little Toomai, who had seen what never man had seen before--the dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the Garo hills!", "(The song that Toomai's mother sang to the baby)", "You can work it out by Fractions or by simple Rule of Three,   But the way of Tweedle-dum is not the way of Tweedle-dee.   You can twist it, you can turn it, you can plait it till you drop,   But the way of Pilly Winky's not the way of Winkie Pop!", "Behind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet squelching and slipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and fro like a strayed hen's. Luckily, I knew enough of beast language--not wild-beast language, but camp-beast language, of course--from the natives to know what he was saying.", "He must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he called to the mule, \"What shall I do? Where shall I go? I have fought with a white thing that waved, and it took a stick and hit me on the neck.\" (That was my broken tent pole, and I was very glad to know it.) \"Shall we run on?\"", "\"Oh, it was you,\" said the mule, \"you and your friends, that have been disturbing the camp? All right. You'll be beaten for this in the morning. But I may as well give you something on account now.\"", "I heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel two kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum. \"Another time,\" he said, \"you'll know better than to run through a mule battery at night, shouting `Thieves and fire!' Sit down, and keep your silly neck quiet.\"", "The camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down whimpering. There was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness, and a big troop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade, jumped a gun tail, and landed close to the mule.", "\"It's disgraceful,\" he said, blowing out his nostrils. \"Those camels have racketed through our lines again--the third time this week. How's a horse to keep his condition if he isn't allowed to sleep. Who's here?\"", "\"I'm the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw Battery,\" said the mule, \"and the other's one of your friends. He's waked me up too. Who are you?\"", "\"Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers--Dick Cunliffe's horse. Stand over a little, there.\"", "\"Oh, beg your pardon,\" said the mule. \"It's too dark to see much. Aren't these camels too sickening for anything? I walked out of my lines to get a little peace and quiet here.\"", "\"My lords,\" said the camel humbly, \"we dreamed bad dreams in the night, and we were very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th Native Infantry, and I am not as brave as you are, my lords.\"", "\"Then why didn't you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native Infantry, instead of running all round the camp?\" said the mule.", "\"They were such very bad dreams,\" said the camel. \"I am sorry. Listen! What is that? Shall we run on again?\"", "\"Sit down,\" said the mule, \"or you'll snap your long stick-legs between the guns.\" He cocked one ear and listened. \"Bullocks!\" he said. \"Gun bullocks. On my word, you and your friends have waked the camp very thoroughly. It takes a good deal of prodding to put up a gun-bullock.\"", "I heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won't go any nearer to the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost stepping on the chain was another battery mule, calling wildly for \"Billy.\"", "\"That's one of our recruits,\" said the old mule to the troop horse. \"He's calling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The dark never hurt anybody yet.\"", "The gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud, but the young mule huddled close to Billy.", "\"Things!\" he said. \"Fearful and horrible, Billy! They came into our lines while we were asleep. D'you think they'll kill us?\"", "\"I've a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking,\" said Billy. \"The idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the battery before this gentleman!\"", "\"Gently, gently!\" said the troop-horse. \"Remember they are always like this to begin with. The first time I ever saw a man (it was in Australia when I was a three-year-old) I ran for half a day, and if I'd seen a camel, I should have been running still.\"", "Nearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to India from Australia, and are broken in by the troopers themselves.", "\"True enough,\" said Billy. \"Stop shaking, youngster. The first time they put the full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on my forelegs and kicked every bit of it off. I hadn't learned the real science of kicking then, but the battery said they had never seen anything like it.\"", "\"H'm!\" said Billy. \"As soon as I heard the camels were loose I came away on my own account. When a battery--a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks gentlemen, he must be very badly shaken up. Who are you fellows on the ground there?\"", "\"That comes of being afraid,\" said Billy. \"You get laughed at by gun-bullocks. I hope you like it, young un.\"", "The young mule's teeth snapped, and I heard him say something about not being afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world. But the bullocks only clicked their horns together and went on chewing.", "\"That's all very well in camp,\" said Billy. \"I'm not above stampeding myself, for the fun of the thing, when I haven't been out for a day or two. But what do you do on active service?\"", "\"Oh, that's quite another set of new shoes,\" said the troop horse. \"Dick Cunliffe's on my back then, and drives his knees into me, and all I have to do is to watch where I am putting my feet, and to keep my hind legs well under me, and be bridle-wise.\"", "\"What's bridle-wise?\" said the young mule.", "\"Don't the knives hurt?\" said the young mule.", "\"Well, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasn't Dick's fault--\"", "\"A lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!\" said the young mule.", "\"Don't you ever trip?\" said the troop-horse.", "\"Fired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing!\" said the troop-horse, thinking hard. \"I couldn't stand that. I should want to charge--with Dick.\"", "\"Oh, no, you wouldn't. You know that as soon as the guns are in position they'll do all the charging. That's scientific and neat. But knives--pah!\"", "The baggage-camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time past, anxious to get a word in edgewise. Then I heard him say, as he cleared his throat, nervously:", "\"I--I--I have fought a little, but not in that climbing way or that running way.\"", "\"No. Now you mention it,\" said Billy, \"you don't look as though you were made for climbing or running--much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?\"", "\"The proper way,\" said the camel. \"We all sat down--\"", "\"Oh, my crupper and breastplate!\" said the troop-horse under his breath. \"Sat down!\"", "\"We sat down--a hundred of us,\" the camel went on, \"in a big square, and the men piled our packs and saddles, outside the square, and they fired over our backs, the men did, on all sides of the square.\"", "\"What sort of men? Any men that came along?\" said the troop-horse. \"They teach us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across us, but Dick Cunliffe is the only man I'd trust to do that. It tickles my girths, and, besides, I can't see with my head on the ground.\"", "\"What does it matter who fires across you?\" said the camel. \"There are plenty of men and plenty of other camels close by, and a great many clouds of smoke. I am not frightened then. I sit still and wait.\"", "\"And yet,\" said Billy, \"you dream bad dreams and upset the camp at night. Well, well! Before I'd lie down, not to speak of sitting down, and let a man fire across me, my heels and his head would have something to say to each other. Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?\"", "There was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his big head and said, \"This is very foolish indeed. There is only one way of fighting.\"", "\"Oh, go on,\" said Billy. \"Please don't mind me. I suppose you fellows fight standing on your tails?\"", "\"Only one way,\" said the two together. (They must have been twins.) \"This is that way. To put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon as Two Tails trumpets.\" (\"Two Tails\" is camp slang for the elephant.)", "\"What does Two Tails trumpet for?\" said the young mule.", "\"Oh! And you choose that time for grazing?\" said the young mule.", "\"Well, I've certainly learned something tonight,\" said the troop-horse. \"Do you gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat when you are being fired at with big guns, and Two Tails is behind you?\"", "\"Of course,\" said the troop horse, \"everyone is not made in the same way, and I can quite see that your family, on your father's side, would fail to understand a great many things.\"", "\"Never you mind my family on my father's side,\" said Billy angrily, for every mule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey. \"My father was a Southern gentleman, and he could pull down and bite and kick into rags every horse he came across. Remember that, you big brown Brumby!\"", "Brumby means wild horse without any breeding. Imagine the feelings of Sunol if a car-horse called her a \"skate,\" and you can imagine how the Australian horse felt. I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark.", "\"On your hind legs!\" squealed Billy. They both reared up facing each other, and I was expecting a furious fight, when a gurgly, rumbly voice, called out of the darkness to the right--\"Children, what are you fighting about there? Be quiet.\"", "Both beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither horse nor mule can bear to listen to an elephant's voice.", "\"It's Two Tails!\" said the troop-horse. \"I can't stand him. A tail at each end isn't fair!\"", "\"My feelings exactly,\" said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for company. \"We're very alike in some things.\"", "\"I suppose we've inherited them from our mothers,\" said the troop horse. \"It's not worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied up?\"", "\"Yes,\" said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his trunk. \"I'm picketed for the night. I've heard what you fellows have been saying. But don't be afraid. I'm not coming over.\"", "The bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, \"Afraid of Two Tails--what nonsense!\" And the bullocks went on, \"We are sorry that you heard, but it is true. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?\"", "\"Well,\" said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly like a little boy saying a poem, \"I don't quite know whether you'd understand.\"", "\"We don't, but we have to pull the guns,\" said the bullocks.", "\"I know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think you are. But it's different with me. My battery captain called me a Pachydermatous Anachronism the other day.\"", "\"That's another way of fighting, I suppose?\" said Billy, who was recovering his spirits.", "\"You don't know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt and between, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what will happen when a shell bursts, and you bullocks can't.\"", "\"I can,\" said the troop-horse. \"At least a little bit. I try not to think about it.\"", "\"I can see more than you, and I do think about it. I know there's a great deal of me to take care of, and I know that nobody knows how to cure me when I'm sick. All they can do is to stop my driver's pay till I get well, and I can't trust my driver.\"", "\"Ah!\" said the troop horse. \"That explains it. I can trust Dick.\"", "\"You could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without making me feel any better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough to go on in spite of it.\"", "\"We do not understand,\" said the bullocks.", "\"I know you don't. I'm not talking to you. You don't know what blood is.\"", "\"We do,\" said the bullocks. \"It is red stuff that soaks into the ground and smells.\"", "The troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.", "\"Don't talk of it,\" he said. \"I can smell it now, just thinking of it. It makes me want to run--when I haven't Dick on my back.\"", "\"But it is not here,\" said the camel and the bullocks. \"Why are you so stupid?\"", "\"It's vile stuff,\" said Billy. \"I don't want to run, but I don't want to talk about it.\"", "\"There you are!\" said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain.", "\"Surely. Yes, we have been here all night,\" said the bullocks.", "Two Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled. \"Oh, I'm not talking to you. You can't see inside your heads.\"", "\"No. We see out of our four eyes,\" said the bullocks. \"We see straight in front of us.\"", "\"That's all very fine,\" said Billy. \"But giving a thing a long name doesn't make it any better.\"", "\"H'sh!\" said the troop horse. \"I think I understand what Two Tails means.\"", "\"You'll understand better in a minute,\" said Two Tails angrily. \"Now you just explain to me why you don't like this!\"", "He began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet.", "\"Stop that!\" said Billy and the troop horse together, and I could hear them stamp and shiver. An elephant's trumpeting is always nasty, especially on a dark night.", "\"Seems to me,\" said Billy to the troop horse, \"that our friend Two Tails is afraid of most things. Now, if I had a full meal for every dog I've kicked across the parade-ground I should be as fat as Two Tails nearly.\"", "\"Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!\" he said. \"It runs in our family. Now, where has that nasty little beast gone to?\"", "I heard him feeling about with his trunk.", "\"We all seem to be affected in various ways,\" he went on, blowing his nose. \"Now, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted.\"", "\"Not alarmed, exactly,\" said the troop-horse, \"but it made me feel as though I had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don't begin again.\"", "\"I'm frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is frightened by bad dreams in the night.\"", "\"It is very lucky for us that we haven't all got to fight in the same way,\" said the troop-horse.", "\"What I want to know,\" said the young mule, who had been quiet for a long time--\"what I want to know is, why we have to fight at all.\"", "\"Because we're told to,\" said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt.", "\"Orders,\" said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped.", "\"Hukm hai!\" (It is an order!), said the camel with a gurgle, and Two Tails and the bullocks repeated, \"Hukm hai!\"", "\"Yes, but who gives the orders?\" said the recruit-mule.", "\"The man who walks at your head--Or sits on your back--Or holds the nose rope--Or twists your tail,\" said Billy and the troop-horse and the camel and the bullocks one after the other.", "\"But who gives them the orders?\"", "\"Now you want to know too much, young un,\" said Billy, \"and that is one way of getting kicked. All you have to do is to obey the man at your head and ask no questions.\"", "\"He's quite right,\" said Two Tails. \"I can't always obey, because I'm betwixt and between. But Billy's right. Obey the man next to you who gives the order, or you'll stop all the battery, besides getting a thrashing.\"", "The gun-bullocks got up to go. \"Morning is coming,\" they said. \"We will go back to our lines. It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and we are not very clever. But still, we are the only people to-night who have not been afraid. Good-night, you brave people.\"", "Nobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the conversation, \"Where's that little dog? A dog means a man somewhere about.\"", "\"Here I am,\" yapped Vixen, \"under the gun tail with my man. You big, blundering beast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My man's very angry.\"", "\"Phew!\" said the bullocks. \"He must be white!\"", "\"Of course he is,\" said Vixen. \"Do you suppose I'm looked after by a black bullock-driver?\"", "\"Huah! Ouach! Ugh!\" said the bullocks. \"Let us get away quickly.\"", "They plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their yoke on the pole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed.", "\"Now you have done it,\" said Billy calmly. \"Don't struggle. You're hung up till daylight. What on earth's the matter?\"", "The bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian cattle give, and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and nearly fell down in the mud, grunting savagely.", "\"You'll break your necks in a minute,\" said the troop-horse. \"What's the matter with white men? I live with 'em.\"", "\"They--eat--us! Pull!\" said the near bullock. The yoke snapped with a twang, and they lumbered off together.", "I never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen. We eat beef--a thing that no cattle-driver touches--and of course the cattle do not like it.", "\"May I be flogged with my own pad-chains! Who'd have thought of two big lumps like those losing their heads?\" said Billy.", "\"Never mind. I'm going to look at this man. Most of the white men, I know, have things in their pockets,\" said the troop-horse.", "Billy the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old campaigner, as the troop-horse's head came nuzzling into my breast, and I gave him biscuits, while Vixen, who is a most conceited little dog, told him fibs about the scores of horses that she and I kept.", "\"I'm coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,\" she said. \"Where will you be?\"", "\"On the left hand of the second squadron. I set the time for all my troop, little lady,\" he said politely. \"Now I must go back to Dick. My tail's all muddy, and he'll have two hours' hard work dressing me for parade.\"", "The animals went in two by two,      Hurrah!   The animals went in two by two,   The elephant and the battery mul',   and they all got into the Ark      For to get out of the rain!", "Then I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had come down with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer.", "\"Now,\" said he, \"in what manner was this wonderful thing done?\"", "And the officer answered, \"An order was given, and they obeyed.\"", "\"But are the beasts as wise as the men?\" said the chief.", "\"Would it were so in Afghanistan!\" said the chief, \"for there we obey only our own wills.\"", "\"And for that reason,\" said the native officer, twirling his mustache, \"your Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our Viceroy.\"", "Parade Song of the Camp Animals", "ELEPHANTS OF THE GUN TEAMS", "We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,   The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;   We bowed our necks to service: they ne'er were loosed again,--   Make way there--way for the ten-foot teams      Of the Forty-Pounder train!", "Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball,   And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;   Then we come into action and tug the guns again--   Make way there--way for the twenty yoke      Of the Forty-Pounder train!", "By the brand on my shoulder, the finest of tunes   Is played by the Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons,   And it's sweeter than \"Stables\" or \"Water\" to me--   The Cavalry Canter of \"Bonnie Dundee\"!", "Then feed us and break us and handle and groom,   And give us good riders and plenty of room,   And launch us in column of squadron and see   The way of the war-horse to \"Bonnie Dundee\"!", "As me and my companions were scrambling up a hill,   The path was lost in rolling stones, but we went forward still;   For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,   Oh, it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to     spare!", "Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road;   Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load:   For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,   Oh, it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to     spare!", "To Romain Rolland, my dear friend", "Joy leapt in his father's heart for his son who was quick to learn, thirsty for knowledge; he saw him growing up to become great wise man and priest, a prince among the Brahmans.", "Bliss leapt in his mother's breast when she saw him, when she saw him walking, when she saw him sit down and get up, Siddhartha, strong, handsome, he who was walking on slender legs, greeting her with perfect respect.", "Love touched the hearts of the Brahmans' young daughters when Siddhartha walked through the lanes of the town with the luminous forehead, with the eye of a king, with his slim hips.", "Siddhartha was thus loved by everyone.

Arrow-fast he read in Govinda's soul, read the fear, read the submission.", "O Govinda, he spoke quietly, let's not waste words. Tomorrow, at daybreak I will begin the life of the Samanas. Speak no more of it.", "Siddhartha entered the chamber, where his father was sitting on a mat of bast, and stepped behind his father and remained standing there, until his father felt that someone was standing behind him. Quoth the Brahman: Is that you, Siddhartha? Then say what you came to say.", "Quoth Siddhartha: With your permission, my father. I came to tell you that it is my longing to leave your house tomorrow and go to the ascetics. My desire is to become a Samana. May my father not oppose this.", "Slowly, the Brahman rose; Siddhartha stood silently, his arms folded.", "What are you waiting for? asked the father.", "Quoth Siddhartha: You know what.", "Indignant, the father left the chamber; indignant, he went to his bed and lay down.", "And in the night's last hour, before the day began, he returned, stepped into the room, saw the young man standing there, who seemed tall and like a stranger to him.", "Siddhartha, he spoke, what are you waiting for?", "Will you always stand that way and wait, until it'll becomes morning, noon, and evening?", "You will become tired, Siddhartha.", "You will fall asleep, Siddhartha.", "And would you rather die, than obey your father?", "Siddhartha has always obeyed his father.", "So will you abandon your plan?", "Siddhartha will do what his father will tell him to do.", "The Father touched Siddhartha's shoulder.", "He took his hand from the shoulder of his son and went outside. Siddhartha wavered to the side, as he tried to walk. He put his limbs back under control, bowed to his father, and went to his mother to do as his father had said.", "As he slowly left on stiff legs in the first light of day the still quiet town, a shadow rose near the last hut, who had crouched there, and joined the pilgrim--Govinda.", "You have come, said Siddhartha and smiled.", "In the evening of this day they caught up with the ascetics, the skinny Samanas, and offered them their companionship and--obedience. They were accepted.", "Siddhartha sat upright and learned to breathe sparingly, learned to get along with only few breathes, learned to stop breathing. He learned, beginning with the breath, to calm the beat of his heart, leaned to reduce the beats of his heart, until they were only a few and almost none.", "By his side lived Govinda, his shadow, walked the same paths, undertook the same efforts. They rarely spoke to one another, than the service and the exercises required. Occasionally the two of them went through the villages, to beg for food for themselves and their teachers.", "How do you think, Govinda, Siddhartha spoke one day while begging this way, how do you think did we progress? Did we reach any goals?", "Govinda answered: We have learned, and we'll continue learning. You'll be a great Samana, Siddhartha. Quickly, you've learned every exercise, often the old Samanas have admired you. One day, you'll be a holy man, oh Siddhartha.", "Quoth Govinda: Siddhartha is putting me on. How could you have learned meditation, holding your breath, insensitivity against hunger and pain there among these wretched people?", "Quoth Govinda: We have learned a lot, Siddhartha, there is still much to learn. We are not going around in circles, we are moving up, the circle is a spiral, we have already ascended many a level.", "Siddhartha answered: How old, would you think, is our oldest Samana, our venerable teacher?", "Quoth Govinda: Our oldest one might be about sixty years of age.", "And Govinda mumbled a verse to himself, a verse from an Upanishad:", "He who ponderingly, of a purified spirit, loses himself in the meditation of Atman, unexpressable by words is his blissfulness of his heart.", "But Siddhartha remained silent. He thought about the words which Govinda had said to him and thought the words through to their end.", "Yes, he thought, standing there with his head low, what would remain of all that which seemed to us to be holy? What remains? What can stand the test? And he shook his head.", "Quoth Govinda: You're mocking me. Mock me if you like, Siddhartha! But have you not also developed a desire, an eagerness, to hear these teachings? And have you not at one time said to me, you would not walk the path of the Samanas for much longer?", "Quoth Govinda: Your willingness delights my heart. But tell me, how should this be possible? How should the Gotama's teachings, even before we have heard them, have already revealed their best fruit to us?", "Quoth Siddhartha: Let us eat this fruit and wait for the rest, oh Govinda! But this fruit, which we already now received thanks to the Gotama, consisted in him calling us away from the Samanas! Whether he has also other and better things to give us, oh friend, let us await with calm hearts.", "Govinda was startled and became embarrassed. But Siddhartha put his mouth close to Govinda's ear and whispered to him: Now, I want to show the old man that I've learned something from him.", "On the way, Govinda said: Oh Siddhartha, you have learned more from the Samanas than I knew. It is hard, it is very hard to cast a spell on an old Samana. Truly, if you had stayed there, you would soon have learned to walk on water.", "I do not seek to walk on water, said Siddhartha. Let old Samanas be content with such feats!", "We would like to know, oh charitable one, where the Buddha dwells, the most venerable one, for we are two Samanas from the forest and have come, to see him, the perfected one, and to hear the teachings from his mouth.", "This made Govinda happy, and full of joy he exclaimed: Well so, thus we have reached our destination, and our path has come to an end! But tell us, oh mother of the pilgrims, do you know him, the Buddha, have you seen him with your own eyes?", "Quoth the woman: Many times I have seen him, the exalted one. On many days, I have seen him, walking through the alleys in silence, wearing his yellow cloak, presenting his alms-dish in silence at the doors of the houses, leaving with a filled dish.", "Siddhartha saw him, and he instantly recognised him, as if a god had pointed him out to him. He saw him, a simple man in a yellow robe, bearing the alms-dish in his hand, walking silently.", "Look here! Siddhartha said quietly to Govinda. This one is the Buddha.", "Attentively, Govinda looked at the monk in the yellow robe, who seemed to be in no way different from the hundreds of other monks. And soon, Govinda also realized: This is the one. And they followed him and observed him.", "Thus Gotama walked towards the town, to collect alms, and the two Samanas recognised him solely by the perfection of his calm, by the quietness of his appearance, in which there was no searching, no desire, no imitation, no effort to be seen, only light and peace.", "Today, we'll hear the teachings from his mouth. said Govinda.", "They both followed the Buddha until they reached the town and then returned in silence, for they themselves intended to abstain from on this day. They saw Gotama returning--what he ate could not even have satisfied a bird's appetite, and they saw him retiring into the shade of the mango-trees.", "Behold, then Govinda, the shy one, also stepped forward and spoke: I also take my refuge in the exalted one and his teachings, and he asked to accepted into the community of his disciples and was accepted.", "Govinda, not completely understanding it yet, repeated his question in an impatient tone: Speak up, I beg you, my dear! Tell me, since it could not be any other way, that you also, my learned friend, will take your refuge with the exalted Buddha!", "Siddhartha placed his hand on Govinda's shoulder: You failed to hear my good wish for you, oh Govinda. I'm repeating it: I wish that you would go this path up to its end, that you shall find salvation!", "In this moment, Govinda realized that his friend had left him, and he started to weep.", "Siddhartha! he exclaimed lamentingly.", "But Siddhartha walked through the grove, lost in thought.", "Then he happened to meet Gotama, the exalted one, and when he greeted him with respect and the Buddha's glance was so full of kindness and calm, the young man summoned his courage and asked the venerable one for the permission to talk to him. Silently the exalted one nodded his approval.", "As you please, the venerable one spoke politely.", "Too bold is my speech, Siddhartha continued, but I do not want to leave the exalted one without having honestly told him my thoughts. Does it please the venerable one to listen to me for one moment longer?", "Silently, the Buddha nodded his approval.", "The Buddha's eyes quietly looked to the ground; quietly, in perfect equanimity his inscrutable face was smiling.", "With half of a smile, with an unwavering openness and kindness, Gotama looked into the stranger's eyes and bid him to leave with a hardly noticeable gesture.", "You are wise, oh Samana., the venerable one spoke.", "You know how to talk wisely, my friend. Be aware of too much wisdom!", "The Buddha turned away, and his glance and half of a smile remained forever etched in Siddhartha's memory.", "I saw a man, Siddhartha thought, a single man, before whom I would have to lower my glance. I do not want to lower my glance before any other, not before any other. No teachings will entice me any more, since this man's teachings have not enticed me.", "I am deprived by the Buddha, thought Siddhartha, I am deprived, and even more he has given to me. He has deprived me of my friend, the one who had believed in me and now believes in him, who had been my shadow and is now Gotama's shadow. But he has given me Siddhartha, myself.", "Siddhartha opened his eyes and looked around, a smile filled his face and a feeling of awakening from long dreams flowed through him from his head down to his toes. And it was not long before he walked again, walked quickly like a man who knows what he has got to do.", "In thinking this thoughts, Siddhartha stopped once again, suddenly, as if there was a snake lying in front of him on the path.", "Dedicated to Wilhelm Gundert, my cousin in Japan", "All of this had always existed, and he had not seen it; he had not been with it. Now he was with it, he was part of it. Light and shadow ran through his eyes, stars and moon ran through his heart.", "When the day began, Siddhartha asked his host, the ferryman, to get him across the river. The ferryman got him across the river on his bamboo-raft, the wide water shimmered reddishly in the light of the morning.", "This is a beautiful river, he said to his companion.", "Yes, said the ferryman, a very beautiful river, I love it more than anything. Often I have listened to it, often I have looked into its eyes, and always I have learned from it. Much can be learned from a river.", "I thank you, my benefactor, spoke Siddhartha, disembarking on the other side of the river. I have no gift I could give you for your hospitality, my dear, and also no payment for your work. I am a man without a home, a son of a Brahman and a Samana.", "I did see it, spoke the ferryman, and I haven't expected any payment from you and no gift which would be the custom for guests to bear. You will give me the gift another time.", "Do you think so? asked Siddhartha amusedly.", "Surely. This too, I have learned from the river: everything is coming back! You too, Samana, will come back. Now farewell! Let your friendship be my reward. Commemorate me, when you'll make offerings to the gods.", "On this day, he reached the large city before the evening, and was happy, for he felt the need to be among people. For a long time, he had lived in the forests, and the straw hut of the ferryman, in which he had slept that night, had been the first roof for a long time he has had over his head.", "Thus I am entering this city, Siddhartha thought, with a charming omen. He instantly felt drawn into the grove, but he thought about it, and only now he became aware of how the servants and maids had looked at him at the entrance, how despicable, how distrustful, how rejecting.", "I am still a Samana, he thought, I am still an ascetic and beggar. I must not remain like this, I will not be able to enter the grove like this. And he laughed.", "The next person who came along this path he asked about the grove and for the name of the woman, and was told that this was the grove of Kamala, the famous courtesan, and that, aside from the grove, she owned a house in the city.", "Then, he entered the city. Now he had a goal.", "Weren't you already standing out there yesterday, greeting me? asked Kamala.", "It's true that I've already seen and greeted you yesterday.", "But didn't you yesterday wear a beard, and long hair, and dust in your hair?", "Kamala smiled and played with her fan of peacocks' feathers. And asked: And only to tell me this, Siddhartha has come to me?", "To tell you this and to thank you for being so beautiful. And if it doesn't displease you, Kamala, I would like to ask you to be my friend and teacher, for I know nothing yet of that art which you have mastered in the highest degree.", "Laughing, Kamala exclaimed: No, my dear, he doesn't satisfy me yet. Clothes are what he must have, pretty clothes, and shoes, pretty shoes, and lots of money in his pouch, and gifts for Kamala. Do you know it now, Samana from the forest? Did you mark my words?", "Whatever for should I be afraid of a Samana, a stupid Samana from the forest, who is coming from the jackals and doesn't even know yet what women are?", "Oh, he's strong, the Samana, and he isn't afraid of anything. He could force you, beautiful girl. He could kidnap you. He could hurt you.", "An advice? Why not? Who wouldn't like to give an advice to a poor, ignorant Samana, who is coming from the jackals of the forest?", "Dear Kamala, thus advise me where I should go to, that I'll find these three things most quickly?", "Friend, many would like to know this. You must do what you've learned and ask for money, clothes, and shoes in return. There is no other way for a poor man to obtain money. What might you be able to do?", "I can think. I can wait. I can fast.", "Nothing. But yes, I can also write poetry. Would you like to give me a kiss for a poem?", "I would like to, if I'll like your poem. What would be its title?", "Siddhartha spoke, after he had thought about it for a moment, these verses:", "Into her shady grove stepped the pretty Kamala, At the grove's entrance stood the brown Samana. Deeply, seeing the lotus's blossom, Bowed that man, and smiling Kamala thanked. More lovely, thought the young man, than offerings for gods, More lovely is offering to pretty Kamala.", "Kamala loudly clapped her hands, so that the golden bracelets clanged.", "Beautiful are your verses, oh brown Samana, and truly, I'm losing nothing when I'm giving you a kiss for them.", "Very beautiful are your verses, exclaimed Kamala, if I was rich, I would give you pieces of gold for them. But it will be difficult for you to earn thus much money with verses as you need. For you need a lot of money, if you want to be Kamala's friend.", "The way you're able to kiss, Kamala! stammered Siddhartha.", "Yes, this I am able to do, therefore I do not lack clothes, shoes, bracelets, and all beautiful things. But what will become of you? Aren't you able to do anything else but thinking, fasting, making poetry?", "I also know the sacrificial songs, said Siddhartha, but I do not want to sing them any more. I also know magic spells, but I do not want to speak them any more. I have read the scriptures--", "Stop, Kamala interrupted him. You're able to read? And write?", "Certainly, I can do this. Many people can do this.", "Most people can't. I also can't do it. It is very good that you're able to read and write, very good. You will also still find use for the magic spells.", "In this moment, a maid came running in and whispered a message into her mistress's ear.", "There's a visitor for me, exclaimed Kamala. Hurry and get yourself away, Siddhartha, nobody may see you in here, remember this! Tomorrow, I'll see you again.", "Suddenly, pride flared up in him. He was no Samana any more, it was no longer becoming to him to beg. He gave the rice-cake to a dog and remained without food.", "He had already discovered Kamala's house in the city long before, there he turned up the following day.", "Siddhartha thanked her and laughed, and when she found out that he had not eaten anything yesterday and today, she sent for bread and fruits and treated him to it.", "You've been lucky, she said when they parted, I'm opening one door after another for you. How come? Do you have a spell?", "Well yes, she admitted. But where would you be without me? What would you be, if Kamala wasn't helping you?", "But what if I hadn't been willing?", "Kamala listened to him. She loved his voice, she loved the look from his eyes.", "Perhaps it is so, she said quietly, as you say, friend. But perhaps it is also like this: that Siddhartha is a handsome man, that his glance pleases the women, that therefore good fortune is coming towards him.", "With one kiss, Siddhartha bid his farewell. I wish that it should be this way, my teacher; that my glance shall please you, that always good fortune shall come to me out of your direction!", "Siddhartha went to Kamaswami the merchant, he was directed into a rich house, servants led him between precious carpets into a chamber, where he awaited the master of the house.", "Kamaswami entered, a swiftly, smoothly moving man with very gray hair, with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth. Politely, the host and the guest greeted one another.", "I have been told, the merchant began, that you were a Brahman, a learned man, but that you seek to be in the service of a merchant. Might you have become destitute, Brahman, so that you seek to serve?", "No, said Siddhartha, I have not become destitute and have never been destitute. You should know that I'm coming from the Samanas, with whom I have lived for a long time.", "If you're coming from the Samanas, how could you be anything but destitute? Aren't the Samanas entirely without possessions?", "I am without possessions, said Siddhartha, if this is what you mean. Surely, I am without possessions. But I am so voluntarily, and therefore I am not destitute.", "But what are you planning to live of, being without possessions?", "I haven't thought of this yet, sir. For more than three years, I have been without possessions, and have never thought about of what I should live.", "So you've lived of the possessions of others.", "Presumable this is how it is. After all, a merchant also lives of what other people own.", "Well said. But he wouldn't take anything from another person for nothing; he would give his merchandise in return.", "So it seems to be indeed. Everyone takes, everyone gives, such is life.", "But if you don't mind me asking: being without possessions, what would you like to give?", "Everyone gives what he has. The warrior gives strength, the merchant gives merchandise, the teacher teachings, the farmer rice, the fisher fish.", "Yes indeed. And what is it now what you've got to give? What is it that you've learned, what you're able to do?", "I can think. I can wait. I can fast.", "I believe, that's everything!", "And what's the use of that? For example, the fasting--what is it good for?", "You're right, Samana. Wait for a moment.", "Kamaswami left the room and returned with a scroll, which he handed to his guest while asking: Can you read this?", "Siddhartha looked at the scroll, on which a sales-contract had been written down, and began to read out its contents.", "Excellent, said Kamaswami. And would you write something for me on this piece of paper?", "He handed him a piece of paper and a pen, and Siddhartha wrote and returned the paper.", "Kamaswami read: Writing is good, thinking is better. Being smart is good, being patient is better.", "It is excellent how you're able to write, the merchant praised him. Many a thing we will still have to discuss with one another. For today, I'm asking you to be my guest and to live in this house.", "The friend advised the merchant: Give him from the business he conducts for you a third of the profits, but let him also be liable for the same amount of the losses, when there is a loss. Then, he'll become more zealous.", "Kamaswami followed the advice. But Siddhartha cared little about this. When he made a profit, he accepted it with equanimity; when he made losses, he laughed and said: Well, look at this, so this one turned out badly!", "That's all very nice, exclaimed Kamaswami indignantly, but in fact, you are a merchant after all, one ought to think! Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?", "Once, he said to her: You are like me, you are different from most people. You are Kamala, nothing else, and inside of you, there is a peace and refuge, to which you can go at every hour of the day and be at home at yourself, as I can also do. Few people have this, and yet all could have it.", "Not all people are smart, said Kamala.", "Kamala looked at him with a smile. Again, you're talking about him, she said, again, you're having a Samana's thoughts.", "The courtesan bent over him, took a long look at his face, at his eyes, which had grown tired.", "It might very well be so, Siddhartha said tiredly. I am like you. You also do not love--how else could you practise love as a craft? Perhaps, people of our kind can't love. The childlike people can; that's their secret.", "Then, Siddhartha knew that the game was over, that he could not play it any more. Shivers ran over his body, inside of him, so he felt, something had died.", "Om! he spoke to himself: Om! and again he knew about Brahman, knew about the indestructibility of life, knew about all that is divine, which he had forgotten.", "But this was only a moment, flash. By the foot of the coconut-tree, Siddhartha collapsed, struck down by tiredness, mumbling Om, placed his head on the root of the tree and fell into a deep sleep.", "I have been sleeping, said Siddhartha. However did you get here?", "I thank you, Samana, for watching out over my sleep, spoke Siddhartha. You're friendly, you followers of the exalted one. Now you may go then.", "I'm going, sir. May you, sir, always be in good health.", "Govinda made the gesture of a salutation and said: Farewell.", "Farewell, Govinda, said Siddhartha.", "Permit me to ask, sir, from where do you know my name?", "I know you, oh Govinda, from your father's hut, and from the school of the Brahmans, and from the offerings, and from our walk to the Samanas, and from that hour when you took your refuge with the exalted one in the grove Jetavana.", "You're Siddhartha, Govinda exclaimed loudly. Now, I'm recognising you, and don't comprehend any more how I couldn't recognise you right away. Be welcome, Siddhartha, my joy is great, to see you again.", "It also gives me joy, to see you again. You've been the guard of my sleep, again I thank you for this, though I wouldn't have required any guard. Where are you going to, oh friend?", "I'm going nowhere. We monks are always travelling, whenever it is not the rainy season, we always move from one place to another, live according to the rules if the teachings passed on to us, accept alms, move on. It is always like this. But you, Siddhartha, where are you going to?", "Quoth Siddhartha: With me too, friend, it is as it is with you. I'm going nowhere. I'm just travelling. I'm on a pilgrimage.", "Right so, my dear, you have observed well, your keen eyes see everything. But I haven't said to you that I was a Samana. I said: I'm on a pilgrimage. And so it is: I'm on a pilgrimage.", "You're on a pilgrimage, said Govinda. But few would go on a pilgrimage in such clothes, few in such shoes, few with such hair. Never I have met such a pilgrim, being a pilgrim myself for many years.", "And now, Siddhartha, what are you now?", "I don't know it, I don't know it just like you. I'm travelling. I was a rich man and am no rich man any more, and what I'll be tomorrow, I don't know.", "I've lost them or they me. They somehow happened to slip away from me. The wheel of physical manifestations is turning quickly, Govinda. Where is Siddhartha the Brahman? Where is Siddhartha the Samana? Where is Siddhartha the rich man? Non-eternal things change quickly, Govinda, you know it.", "Govinda looked at the friend of his youth for a long time, with doubt in his eyes. After that, he gave him the salutation which one would use on a gentleman and went on his way.", "Siddhartha thought about his situation. Thinking was hard on him, he did not really feel like it, but he forced himself.", "Wonderfully, he felt joy rolling like waves in his chest.", "Siddhartha rose, the workings of hunger in his body became unbearable. In a daze he walked on, up the path by the bank, upriver, listened to the current, listened to the rumbling hunger in his body.", "When he reached the ferry, the boat was just ready, and the same ferryman who had once transported the young Samana across the river, stood in the boat, Siddhartha recognised him, he had also aged very much.", "Would you like to ferry me over? he asked.", "The ferryman, being astonished to see such an elegant man walking along and on foot, took him into his boat and pushed it off the bank.", "It's a beautiful life you have chosen for yourself, the passenger spoke. It must be beautiful to live by this water every day and to cruise on it.", "With a smile, the man at the oar moved from side to side: It is beautiful, sir, it is as you say. But isn't every life, isn't every work beautiful?", "This may be true. But I envy you for yours.", "Ah, you would soon stop enjoying it. This is nothing for people wearing fine clothes.", "Siddhartha laughed. Once before, I have been looked upon today because of my clothes, I have been looked upon with distrust. Wouldn't you, ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me, from me? For you must know, I have no money to pay your fare.", "You're joking, sir, the ferryman laughed.", "I'm not joking, friend. Behold, once before you have ferried me across this water in your boat for the immaterial reward of a good deed. Thus, do it today as well, and accept my clothes for it.", "And do you, sir, intent to continue travelling without clothes?", "Ah, most of all I wouldn't want to continue travelling at all. Most of all I would like you, ferryman, to give me an old loincloth and kept me with you as your assistant, or rather as your trainee, for I'll have to learn first how to handle the boat.", "For a long time, the ferryman looked at the stranger, searching.", "Now I recognise you, he finally said. At one time, you've slept in my hut, this was a long time ago, possibly more than twenty years ago, and you've been ferried across the river by me, and we parted like good friends. Haven't you've been a Samana? I can't think of your name any more.", "My name is Siddhartha, and I was a Samana, when you've last seen me.", "So be welcome, Siddhartha. My name is Vasudeva. You will, so I hope, be my guest today as well and sleep in my hut, and tell me, where you're coming from and why these beautiful clothes are such a nuisance to you.", "Afterwards, it was almost the time of the sunset, they sat on a log by the bank, and Siddhartha told the ferryman about where he originally came from and about his life, as he had seen it before his eyes today, in that hour of despair. Until late at night, lasted his tale.", "But in the end of Siddhartha's tale, when he spoke of the tree by the river, and of his deep fall, of the holy Om, and how he had felt such a love for the river after his slumber, the ferryman listened with twice the attention, entirely and completely absorbed by it, with his eyes closed.", "I thank you, said Siddhartha, I thank you and accept. And I also thank you for this, Vasudeva, for listening to me so well! These people are rare who know how to listen. And I did not meet a single one who knew it as well as you did. I will also learn in this respect from you.", "Quoth Siddhartha after a long pause: What other thing, Vasudeva?", "In a friendly manner, he lived side by side with Vasudeva, and occasionally they exchanged some words, few and at length thought about words. Vasudeva was no friend of words; rarely, Siddhartha succeeded in persuading him to speak.", "Did you, so he asked him at one time, did you too learn that secret from the river: that there is no time?", "Vasudeva's face was filled with a bright smile.", "So it is, Vasudeva nodded, all voices of the creatures are in its voice.", "And do you know, Siddhartha continued, what word it speaks, when you succeed in hearing all of its ten thousand voices at once?", "Happily, Vasudeva's face was smiling, he bent over to Siddhartha and spoke the holy Om into his ear. And this had been the very thing which Siddhartha had also been hearing.", "He's with you, don't worry, said Siddhartha.", "Siddhartha smiled: Instantly, I recognised you, Kamala, my dear.", "Kamala pointed to her boy and said: Did you recognise him as well? He is your son.", "She'll die, Siddhartha said quietly.", "Vasudeva nodded; over his friendly face ran the light of the stove's fire.", "Once again, Kamala returned to consciousness. Pain distorted her face, Siddhartha's eyes read the suffering on her mouth, on her pale cheeks. Quietly, he read it, attentively, waiting, his mind becoming one with her suffering. Kamala felt it, her gaze sought his eyes.", "Looking at him, she said: Now I see that your eyes have changed as well. They've become completely different. By what do I still recognise that you're Siddhartha? It's you, and it's not you.", "Siddhartha said nothing, quietly his eyes looked at hers.", "You have achieved it? she asked. You have found peace?", "He smiled and placed his hand on hers.", "I'm seeing it, she said, I'm seeing it. I too will find peace.", "You have found it, Siddhartha spoke in a whisper.", "Early in the morning, even before the sun could be seen, Vasudeva came out of the stable and walked over to his friend.", "No, Vasudeva. I sat here, I was listening to the river. A lot it has told me, deeply it has filled me with the healing thought, with the thought of oneness.", "You've experienced suffering, Siddhartha, but I see: no sadness has entered your heart.", "No, my dear, how should I be sad? I, who have been rich and happy, have become even richer and happier now. My son has been given to me.", "Your son shall be welcome to me as well. But now, Siddhartha, let's get to work, there is much to be done. Kamala has died on the same bed, on which my wife had died a long time ago. Let us also build Kamala's funeral pile on the same hill on which I had then built my wife's funeral pile.", "While the boy was still asleep, they built the funeral pile.", "Troubled, Siddhartha looked into his friendly face, in the many wrinkles of which there was incessant cheerfulness.", "How could I part with him? he said quietly, ashamed. Give me some more time, my dear! See, I'm fighting for him, I'm seeking to win his heart, with love and with friendly patience I intent to capture it. One day, the river shall also talk to him, he also is called upon.", "No, Vasudeva, I don't do anything of this.", "Troubled, Siddhartha looked to the ground. Quietly, he asked: What do you think should I do?", "Rage and grief boiled over in him, foamed at the father in a hundred savage and evil words. Then the boy ran away and only returned late at night.", "I must follow him, said Siddhartha, who had been shivering with grief since those ranting speeches, the boy had made yesterday. A child can't go through the forest all alone. He'll perish. We must build a raft, Vasudeva, to get over the water.", "Siddhartha did not answer. He already held the axe in his hands and began to make a raft of bamboo, and Vasudeva helped him to tied the canes together with ropes of grass. Then they crossed over, drifted far off their course, pulled the raft upriver on the opposite bank.", "Why did you take the axe along? asked Siddhartha.", "Vasudeva said: It might have been possible that the oar of our boat got lost.", "But the wound still burned, longingly and bitterly Siddhartha thought of his son, nurtured his love and tenderness in his heart, allowed the pain to gnaw at him, committed all foolish acts of love. Not by itself, this flame would go out.", "Vasudeva was sitting in the hut and weaving a basket. He no longer used the ferry-boat, his eyes were starting to get weak, and not just his eyes; his arms and hands as well. Unchanged and flourishing was only the joy and the cheerful benevolence of his face.", "When he had finished talking, Vasudeva turned his friendly eyes, which had grown slightly weak, at him, said nothing, let his silent love and cheerfulness, understanding and knowledge, shine at him. He took Siddhartha's hand, led him to the seat by the bank, sat down with him, smiled at the river.", "You've heard it laugh, he said. But you haven't heard everything. Let's listen, you'll hear more.", "Do you hear? Vasudeva's mute gaze asked. Siddhartha nodded.", "Listen better! Vasudeva whispered.", "Do you hear, Vasudeva's gaze asked again.", "Siddhartha made a deep bow before him who bid his farewell.", "I've known it, he said quietly. You'll go into the forests?", "I'm going into the forests, I'm going into the oneness, spoke Vasudeva with a bright smile.", "With a bright smile, he left; Siddhartha watched him leaving. With deep joy, with deep solemnity he watched him leave, saw his steps full of peace, saw his head full of lustre, saw his body full of light.", "He came to the river and asked the old man to ferry him over, and when they got off the boat on the other side, he said to the old man: You're very good to us monks and pilgrims, you have already ferried many of us across the river. Aren't you too, ferryman, a searcher for the right path?", "Quoth Siddhartha, smiling from his old eyes: Do you call yourself a searcher, oh venerable one, though you are already of an old in years and are wearing the robe of Gotama's monks?", "It's true, I'm old, spoke Govinda, but I haven't stopped searching. Never I'll stop searching, this seems to be my destiny. You too, so it seems to me, have been searching. Would you like to tell me something, oh honourable one?", "Quoth Siddhartha: What should I possibly have to tell you, oh venerable one? Perhaps that you're searching far too much? That in all that searching, you don't find the time for finding?", "I don't quite understand yet, asked Govinda, what do you mean by this?", "Quoth Siddhartha: A long time ago, oh venerable one, many years ago, you've once before been at this river and have found a sleeping man by the river, and have sat down with him to guard his sleep. But, oh Govinda, you did not recognise the sleeping man.", "Astonished, as if he had been the object of a magic spell, the monk looked into the ferryman's eyes.", "Are you Siddhartha? he asked with a timid voice. I wouldn't have recognised you this time as well! From my heart, I'm greeting you, Siddhartha; from my heart, I'm happy to see you once again! You've changed a lot, my friend.--And so you've now become a ferryman?", "In a friendly manner, Siddhartha laughed. A ferryman, yes. Many people, Govinda, have to change a lot, have to wear many a robe, I am one of those, my dear. Be welcome, Govinda, and spend the night in my hut.", "Govinda stayed the night in the hut and slept on the bed which used to be Vasudeva's bed. Many questions he posed to the friend of his youth, many things Siddhartha had to tell him from his life.", "Are you kidding? asked Govinda.", "How come? asked Govinda timidly.", "Siddhartha bent down, picked up a stone from the ground, and weighed it in his hand.", "Why have you told me this about the stone? he asked hesitantly after a pause.", "Quoth Govinda: Not just a word, my friend, is Nirvana. It is a thought.", "Govinda said: But is that what you call `things', actually something real, something which has existence? Isn't it just a deception of the Maja, just an image and illusion? Your stone, your tree, your river-- are they actually a reality?", "This I understand, spoke Govinda. But this very thing was discovered by the exalted one to be a deception. He commands benevolence, clemency, sympathy, tolerance, but not love; he forbade us to tie our heart in love to earthly things.", "As Govinda thought like this, and there was a conflict in his heart, he once again bowed to Siddhartha, drawn by love. Deeply he bowed to him who was calmly sitting.", "Siddhartha said nothing and looked at him with the ever unchanged, quiet smile. Govinda stared at his face, with fear, with yearning, suffering, and the eternal search was visible in his look, eternal not-finding.", "Bend down to me! he whispered quietly in Govinda's ear. Bend down to me! Like this, even closer! Very close! Kiss my forehead, Govinda!"]
